in 1998 , the yili autonomous prefecture cpc committee and the yili prefecture cpc committee made unified arrangements and sent on a trial basis several propaganda teams deep into the schools , villagers ' courtyards , and fields to carry out face - to - face propaganda among the people of all nationalities .
in many rural areas , the masses sat on the grassland , in the football fields , or under the trees and conscientiously listened to the propaganda lectures .
an old man from sadikeweizi village of sadikeweizi township in yining county firmly held a propaganda team member by hand , asking him to go to his house to give a lecture to his children . he said : " if only you had come here to give us propaganda lectures two years before !
yibulayin , a farmer from alamutuya village of yingyeer township in yining city , said : " a country is just like a family and the government is just like a parent . if the parent often teaches his children , his children will make fewer mistakes . "
when i first came here , i thought that it would be difficult for us to gather the villagers together and even if we could gather them together , some of them would leave the site before a propaganda lecture ended .
while carrying out the propaganda activity , the propaganda team members displayed a spirit of bearing hardships and enduring hard work .
in those seven days , in order to save time , they ate dry crusty pancakes and drank plain boiled water during the day and lived in the herdsmen 's yurts at night .
sometimes , they would especially rush to an area in order to give a propaganda lecture to only a few people .
apart from sparing no effort to carry out the propaganda activity from village to village , the propaganda team members also find time to help the local people tackle difficulties and problems in their production and livelihood and joined them in fighting the floods and providing disaster relief .
song jian , vice chairman of the national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference and president of the chinese academy of engineering , attended the appraisal meeting .

economists here maintain that the strategy of developing western china was a timely one .
according to the concept , central and western china should first give consideration to the national interests by supporting the opening up and development of coastal areas in the east .
then , when the east has reached a certain stage of development , it should help central and western china speed up its development with even more resources in return .
moreover , owing to the deflation trend , the state has adopted certain active fiscal policies to boost the economy , creating the situation where the government can afford to support the development of the west with even more resources .
according to zeng peiyuan , minister in charge of the state development planning commission , this year the government will draw up additional preferential policies for encouraging foreign businesses to invest in western china and will spend more loans from international organizations on construction projects in the west .
this year , the state will continue to tilt its investments toward western china , the next five - year plan will include a special plan for the development of the west , and the government will invest a larger percentage of money incurred from floating national bonds in projects in western china .
according to the experts , china 's economic development in recent years has been hindered by inadequate demand at home , and considerable portion of technology and labor are seeking new areas of production , new markets , and new areas of development .
china has basically addressed the problem of feeding the people . its food supply is higher than demand . this has created the rare opportunity for the development of western china .
our forefathers said : preparedness ensures success , and unpreparedness spells failure , which means that in doing everything , it is necessary to make thorough preparations and well - conceived plans .
the central authorities stressed that in developing the western region , things must be done in accordance with the scientific law , as the formulation of scientific and meticulous plans is both demanded by the intrinsic law governing the regional economic development , and has definite objectives in view .
making a scientific plan will help maintain unflagging enthusiasm and enhance the prudent and rational spirit , so that good intentions will reap good results and the large - scale development of the western region will obtain great achievements .
a scientific plan has both its guiding function and binding force .
to draw up an authoritative plan , we must also pay attention to coordination and comprehensive equilibrium .
as a dozen provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions as well as the xinjiang production and construction corps are involved in the western development , various localities , especially the neighboring provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions , must coordinate with one another in drafting plans .
if they only proceed from the interests of their own provinces , areas , or units regardless of the overall situation of the western development , they are unable to play a harmonious and resonant symphony for the development of west china .
2 ) the masses ' wishes must be respected , and their initiative and creativeness must be brought into full play .
the practice for many years has shown that even if we do things with good intentions , we must also fully respect the masses ' wishes , and only by arousing the masses ' enthusiasm to work with one heart can we initiate an excellent situation for the western development .
news that has recently spread here indicates that some localities in the western region have introduced or are studying the introduction of preferential policies , hoping to import funds from the eastern region and foreign countries through various methods .
once their doubts and misgivings are cleared , they will vie with one another to make bold investment in the western region .
therefore , making a good plan is conducive to creating a fully appealing investment environment .
scientific , complete water conservancy construction plans must be drawn up in accordance with the demands of the overall mission and overall goals of national economic and social development , and must be in line with overall planning for national economic and social development .
the ministry of water resources must draw up a comprehensive national plan for water conservancy construction development to be used in guiding the work of water conservancy nationwide .
flood prevention and development plans must also be drawn up for the major river basins .
at the same time , plans for various types of special projects must be put in place .
water conservancy projects within a river basin must all be carried out under the guidance of the overall plan and the plan for the river basin .
flood prevention is the primary mission , and it is also work that must be done frequently and diligently .
flood prevention must be integrated with water conservation , ecological protection , and pollution prevention and control .
in addition , non - engineering measures such as meteorology , hydrology , monitoring , communications , information systems , and the like must be strengthened .
water conservancy projects must establish management while placing emphasis on the right things , which means that while project quality must be taken seriously , maintenance and upkeep must also be strengthened .
proper handling requires making the relationships among what is possible , the current situation and the long - term .
according to the unified plan , major issues relating to the national economy and people 's livelihood and urgent problems are resolved first , and moreover are integrated with the fulfillment of long - range planning goals .
according to the request made by general secretary jiang zemin , we must insist on taking time to reach decisions , comprehensive consideration , scientific selections and comparisons , and meticulous designs for major water conservancy projects .
fourth , ensure project quality .
in the recent period of time , in accordance with requests from the central government and relevant national regulations , the ministry of water resources has taken a series of measures to strengthen project quality management , and has achieved remarkable success .
however , many problems still remain in water conservancy projects .
wen jiabao stressed that flood prevention and drought resistance relate to the lives , property , and security of the people , and must be given high regard at all times .
third , we must raise the level of modern flood - prevention and drought resistance technology .
establish modernized meteorological , hydrological , and communications facilities , strengthen analysis and research of rainfall and water conditions , and improve the accuracy of forecasting .
he called on the comrades at the national prevention office to be faithful in the discharge of their duties , diligent and responsible , and to serve selflessly to raise the scientific level and efficiency of the work .
beijing , 3 feb (zts) - - the state council recently approved the establishment of a leadership group for the development of west china , to take overall charge of this development work . zhu rongji has been appointed head of the group , with wen jiabao as deputy head . the members include 17 ministerial - level officials .
the state council leadership group for west china development has an office subordinate to it ; a specific organ has been set up in the state development and planning commission , to undertake the day to day work of the leadership group .
china formally proposed implementing the strategy of major development of west china at the national economic work conference last year .
having been discussed until early this year , this major development strategy is gradually heating up . clues to the thinking on western development are also being gradually revealed .
during the exchanges and mutual visits , people of the same trades from the trade unions of both sides expressed their feelings of hope for reunification and opposition to separation .
to our regret , however , lee teng - hui [ li denghui ] openly trotted out the " two - state theory " when cross - strait relations were developing continuously , thus seriously undermining the foundation for the normal development of cross - strait relations and greatly damaging the interests of taiwan compatriots .
millions of staff and workers and trade unions at all levels throughout the country resolutely oppose this criminal act to split the motherland .
the principle of " one country , two systems " has been understood and accepted by more and more people .
the all - china women 's federation will continue to expand the exchanges and contacts with taiwan women and play its due role in achieving peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait at an early date and opposing the splittist forces in taiwan .
history has proven and will continue to prove that only with the reunification of the motherland can the nation be revitalized comprehensively , and only with national unity can a more brilliant tomorrow be created .
bayinqolu said that in the new century , youths on both sides of the strait should cooperate and work hard together to attain the magnificent goal of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .
at the moment when we say goodbye to the old year and usher in the new year , the all - china federation of trade unions , the cyl central committee , and the all - china women 's federation extended spring festival greetings to the large numbers of laborers , youths , and women in taiwan .
what they regret , however , is that cross - strait ties have developed in tortuous fashion over the past five years .
chen zhengtong said that the taiwan people have a glorious patriotic tradition ; their aspirations to keep their way of life unchanged and to be masters in their own house are fully understood and respected by the cpc and the chinese people 's government .
this is because there is only one china , and taiwan is part of chinese territory ; this is undeniable fact , and no force can change in any way taiwan 's status as a part of chinese territory .
he greatly appreciated president jiang zemin 's remarks in the proposals on " strive to achieve peaceful reunification , chinese should not fight chinese . "
the taiwan people can only achieve happiness through reunification ; and only through reunification can the taiwan compatriots , together with the people of all nationalities in china , truly share in the international dignity and honor of the great motherland .
people on both sides of the strait entertain ardent hopes .
this is naked hegimonism and power politics , and an obvious violation against the three sino - us communiques . the attempts of anti - china politicians to obstruct china 's great cause of reunification by wantonly interfering in china 's internal affairs and backing up the splittist forces of " taiwan independence " is clearly disclosed .
tang jiaxuan notes in his message : china and the world need each other in their development .
it will come up with grand projects and accomplish them , and it will act as a good advisor and assistant to the cpc central committee and the state council .
- - the army , the police force , political - judicial organs , and party and government organs have stopped their involvement in business and in the running of enterprises , depriving some smugglers of their protection and shelter ; the effort against corruption has been intensified , echoing the antismuggling campaign .
the general administration of customs alone has investigated and handled 13 officials at the level of provincial department head or equivalent and 50 officials at the level of provincial section head or equivalent who have violated discipline and law .
- - measures for comprehensive improvement have been implemented and powerful joint forces have developed in the antismuggling campaign .
- - the law enforcement departments have continually conducted large - scale specialized antismuggling operations by focusing on key areas , key channels , and key commodities and kept up the high pressure on smuggling .
the responsible persons at customs emphasized that it is necessary to administer customs strictly and resolutely purge each and every " borer " discovered with no leniency whatsoever .
an effort should be made to significantly strengthen the leadership groups at various levels in the customs sector , significantly raise the quality of the cadre contingent , markedly improve their conduct and discipline , and effectively check the phenomena of corruption in law enforcement within the next two years .
his message reads : on the occasion of the joyous spring festival , i wish the motherland to be prosperous , wealthy , and strong , and the people happy and healthy .
now a task of top priority is to quickly build a mighty contingent of qualified personnel of various types who can meet the strategic needs of the massive development of the western region as well as a contingent of high - quality cadres .
to build a mighty contingent of qualified personnel of various types , it is necessary , above all , for the central authorities to make overall planning , to coordinate efforts to solve problems , and to rationally adjust the distribution and structure of qualified personnel , including the regional structure of quality personnel .
in coordination with relevant departments , the organization department of the cpc central committee is studying and making strategic planning for qualified personnel for the massive development of the western region , strengthening the backbone of the party and government leadership , and assigning high - standard professional personnel to the region through various channels .
by carrying out those measures , we should vigorously improve the age , educational , and professional structures of leading bodies at various levels in order to increase their vitality .
while continuing to do a good job in selecting and sending cadres to xinjiang and tibet , we should step up our efforts to train young cadres of various types to meet the needs of the development of the western region .
we should select in a planned way a number of outstanding young cadres for tempering themselves at central state organs or in economically developed areas with their original positions retained for them , in order to help them widen their field of vision , adopt new ideas , and increase their abilities .
in the past , as a result of rapid economic development and preferential policy on personnel in the eastern region , some qualified personnel in the western region went there to work .
efforts should be made to resolutely eliminate the corrupt phenomenon of spending public funds for wining , dining , and pleasure - seeking and to crack down on economic crimes of embezzling state development funds according to law , such as misappropriating public funds , embezzling public property , and striking deals between money and power .
the massive development of the western region will benefit future generations , and it has a bearing on the great cause of revitalizing the chinese nation in an all - round way . it will take longer - term , arduous efforts to accomplish the undertaking of massive development of the western region .

shanghai , 1 feb (zxs) - - at the first shanghai international industrial fair held at the end of last year , results of development in the fields of high technology , electronic information , electrical equipment , biomedicine , and new materials vividly revealed the new face of shanghai 's modern industrial sector .
the revolution in science and technology that took place in the world economy at the end of the twentieth century , comprised of information technology , biomedicine , new materials , new energy , and aerospace technology , brought with it an inherent tendency toward accelerated development .
only by accelerating the development of high technology and its related industries will we activate the qualitative leap in industrial structures and technological standards and capacities that will transform china in the 21 st century from a great industrialized nation into an industrial power .
our reporter has learned from relevant sources within the china state planning commission that development of china 's high - tech industry will proceed in conformity with promoting economic and social development and stimulating structural adjustments and upgrading . currently , three main responsibilities have been identified : - - to accelerate the coordinated development of the information industry .
in the 20 th century , beginning from the early 1990 's , china 's information industry has consistently shown an annual growth rate of more than 30 percent , and this makes it one of the most rapidly developing sectors of the national economy .
it is for this reason that the market outlook for the information industry in china is so optimistic . it is estimated that by the year 2010 this industry 's market capacity will reach 6 trillion rmb .
for this reason we are selecting those key areas or key links that have favorable prospects , where the degree of industrial linkage will be significant , and which can drive the entire mechanism for critical breakthroughs , and through these we will vigorously strive to realize a leap in high - tech development .
this type of interdependence and mutual stimulus would be difficult to ignore .

moscow , 6 feb ( xinhua ) - - the russian federation security council , chaired by acting prime minister putin , recently approved the draft of a new military doctrine .
the new doctrine stresses that when russia itself and its allies suffer aggression , and a war aimed at destroying russia cannot be stopped by conventional weapons , russia has the right to use nuclear weapons .
this shows that russia will be the first to launch a nuclear attack , when it believes it necessary .
the russian military emphasizes that the new military doctrine gives russia the right to take the initiative in launching a nuclear strike against the enemy .
the three baltic states and certain mideast countries are also eager to try to join nato at an early date .
after that , ignoring the opposition of many countries , including russia , and without un authorization , us - led nato wantonly waged a 78 - day large - scale air war against the yugoslav federation .
acting russian prime minister putin specifically pointed out at the recent russian federation security council meeting that the new military doctrine is " a reply to nato . "
this means that russia now regards us - led nato as its " no . 1 imaginary enemy . "
yeshin , director of the military construction bureau of the council , said that due to its economic difficulties and shortage of military funds , russia cannot fight a conventional war with nato for the foreseeable future .
in order to be respected by others , it is essential to maintain nuclear potential and regard nuclear weapons as " political instruments for curbing the enemy . "
all kinds of gang crimes have become a major factor affecting social stability and economic growth .
military analysts here believe that the new russian military doctrine is an expansion and extension in the military sphere of the " russian security concept " which was adopted in january , and is also a " war warning . "
nato will think thrice about taking major military action again that threatens russia and its allies .
nuclear arms will play a still greater deterrent role as the " trump cards " preserving russia 's great power status and vital interests .

bush got 30 percent of the vote , placing him second .
analysts believe that the new hampshire primary means that bush is facing a serious new challenge , and also shows that the struggle for the republican party nomination is getting much hotter .
however , this little state occupies a decisive position during the presidential primaries , and not only can it make the next president , it can also bury the political prospects of presidential candidates .
the situation over the past 10 - 20 years shows that most of those who gain the white house have won in the new hampshire primaries .
his campaign strategy relies heavily on the economic card , energetically touting the economic achievements since he and clinton took office as well as claiming that only he has the experience and the ability to " maintain america 's prosperity . "
bradley tried to turn the situation around in new hampshire after his resounding defeat in the iowa primary , but was ineffective .
gore said that the new hampshire primary was a " crushing blow " to bradley .
the new hampshire primaries have turned the original five - man race in the republican party into a two - man struggle , with fight for the nomination being primarily between bush and mccain .
there he adopted the campaign strategy of " concentrating superior forces , " throwing more time and money into it than any other candidate did and organizing more than 100 voter rallies statewide .
in the polls conducted before the primary , support for mccain exceed that for bush for eight weeks in a row .
during the campaign , bush stated that his large tax cut plan represents the interest of conservative republicans , and that he is the only one with the ability to take back the white house in the presidential election in november .
he charged that mccain 's tax cut plan was similar to that of clinton 's .
he has indicated that he would pursue campaign finance reforms to eliminate money 's influence in politics .
public opinion believes that in new hampshire , independents voters - - who are neither democratic nor republican - - account for as much as 40 percent , and this part of the electorate played an important role in mccain 's primary victory .
following new hampshire , gore and bradley will start a new round of competition on march 7 .
at that time , 16 states nationwide will conduct primaries on the same day .
prior to the 7 march primaries , the republican presidential candidates will also confront each other again in delaware , south carolina , arizona , and michigan .
the world economic forum 's first meeting of the new millennium held in the small town of davos in eastern switzerland spanned six days and came to a close on 1 february .

the focus of this annual meeting is no longer on how to resolve the thorny crisis situation ; rather it is to explore the more basic , long - term issues in world economic development .
economic globalization has made the countries around the world increasingly more dependent on one another for economic development .
the united states ' economy has been the engine driving world economic growth in recent years .
to date , that economy has sustained 107 months of continuous growth .
in the " new economic " era , when information technology continues to drive economic growth , the united states ' economy continues to have growth potential , but there is also potential danger in their stock market bubble and soaring corporate and personal debt .
in addition , china 's economy as a growing force to be reckoned with in the global economy is another area that attracted much attention .

jordan 's king abdullah ii said in his speech that today more than half of the world 's population is still subsisting on less than $ 2 a day , while the richest one - fifth of the world 's population owns more than 66 times the resources of the poorest one - fifth .
south africa 's president mbeki said that the information revolution brought by the internet has further widened the gap between the developing and the developed countries .

this annual meeting was held at the beginning of the new millennium under fairly good world economic conditions , but klaus schwab , founder of the world economic forum , said at the opening ceremony on the 27 th that people must not be complacent .
wan guoquan , president of the china council for promoting peaceful reunification , spoke at the meeting .
he expressed the belief that through cross - strait talks , a solution can surely be found that will not only satisfy the wishes and demands of taiwan compatriots but also fully take into consideration the interests of various social classes in taiwan .
more and more taiwan compatriots will finally come to believe that the " one country , two systems " is the best way to safeguard the interests of all concerned .
he said that hainan will realistically protect the legitimate rights and interests of taiwan investors in hainan , further promote and actuate the building of the cross - strait ( hainan ) agricultural cooperative experimental zone , and give further impetus to exchanges and cooperation between the two islands of hainan and taiwan .
in the meantime , he also affirmed the contributions made by taiwan compatriots in hainan 's development and construction .
representatives of taiwan compatriots , taiwan businessmen , family members of taiwan compatriots and related organs and mass organizations gave speeches at the forum one after another .
lee ch ' iung - mei , vice president of the provincial committee of the all - china federation of taiwan compatriots , said : president jiang zemin 's speech given five years ago showed strong affections and sincerity , having a very strong influential power .
the reunification of the motherland and family reunion symbolize the love of compatriots and the basic demands of national sentiments .
cai changsong , deputy secretary of the hainan provincial cpc committee ; hong shouxiang , standing committee member of the provincial party committee and director of the propaganda department ; and li dongsheng and wang qiongying , vice governors of hainan province , attended the forum .
it said : life will only become harder if us forces are garrisoned for the long term in kosovo .
i cannot help but recall two old chinese sayings after reading this article : getting enmeshed in a web of one 's own spinning , and lifting a rock only to drop it on one 's own feet , which truly portray the dilemma in which the united states is caught in kosovo .
last march , us - led nato flaunted the banner of humanitarianism , and wantonly and indiscriminately bombed the federal republic of yugoslavia [ fry ] without un security council authorization .
for a period of time , the us government , public , and media boasted enormously about their victory and were insufferably arrogant .
however , as time goes by , some people have to admit that the severity of the outcome of this war is unexpected .
ethnic conflicts have intensified further instead of disappearing after us - led nato troops were garrisoned in kosovo in the name of un peacekeeping .
us defense secretary cohen flew to munich last week , hoping also to work on the european allies .
he complained : us forces serve as policemen in kosovo but lack the training required , and the us government does not wish them to do such work . the kosovo situation has the tendency to get out of control , and the european allies should shoulder more obligations .
according to us claims , the european allies have agreed to garrison police units in kosovo , and will form a multinational force before april this year to uphold peace in kosovo , so that us forces can extricate themselves .
some people even believe that the united states asked for it since it refused to heed advice initially and had made a mess of things .
people here opined : the prerequisite for the united states to militarily withdraw from kosovo is the agreement of european countries to fill the vacuum left by us forces , but persuading the european allies to help clear up the messy situation is easier said than done .
the united states has always wanted to become the world 's big brother , and has promoted power politics and hegemonism everywhere . if it continues to be its old self , it will not be able to avoid the disastrous roads of failure it took in north korea , vietnam , somalia , and other places .
professor chang lin - chih of taiwan university pointed out in a taiwan tv program that the taiwan authorities have erected obstacles over the question of cross - strait transport links , with the result that it is completely impossible to develop the " asia - pacific operations center . "
taiwan 's chang jung aviation , which is closely following china airlines in establishing an office in beijing , will also soon establish an office in shanghai .
in order to respond to the vast business opportunities in the future when there are direct cross - strait flights , taiwan 's fu hsing aviation has spent a huge sum on buying medium and long - range versions of the european airbus .
as for sea transport , all shipping companies hold that direct routes represent the inevitable trend , and it is absolutely impossible to ignore the important status and impact of the mainland 's vast market in asia .
in the past few years , though cross - strait relations have gone through twists and turns as well as storms , tremendous changes have also taken place in this regard .
all this eloquently proves that the desire of the chinese people to realize the reunification of the motherland is an irresistible historical trend .
hong kong and macao have successively returned to the motherland , and the historic task of striving to settle the taiwan issue and realizing the reunification of the motherland at an early date is now ever more prominently placed before us .
hong kong and macao have returned to the motherland one after the other , and the influence produced by the practice of " one country , two systems " has been continuously increasing .
now more and more people favor " one country , two system " ; since it has successfully solved the hong kong and macao questions , it can certainly apply to settle the taiwan issue .
in the course of " equal consultation and mutual discussion on reunification " as called by wang daohan , chairman of the association for relations across the taiwan strait (arats) , everything possible should be done to maintain the status quo and to not harm the fundamental interests of the parties concerned .
( 2 ) the course of reunification : the objective of reunifying the motherland can be achieved step by step .
the " two - state " theory has also been rebuffed everywhere in the international community .
the fact that the principle of one china has been widely accepted by the international community shows that the " two - state " theory is but a lost move by the taiwan separatist forces as a result of their misappraisal of the situation .
the vital interests , major principles , and great justice of the chinese nation require the reunification of the motherland .
it should be particularly pointed out here that the principle of one china is the most important basis of cross - strait relations .
when the principle of one china is observed , there will be an opportunity for the development and improvement of cross - strait relations ; otherwise , cross - strait relations will be bound to come to a halt or even retrograde .
( 2 ) to prevent " taiwan independence " and interference by foreign forces , we must effectively make preparations for safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country .
of course , peaceful reunification cannot be accomplished at one stroke , and the fulfillment of the ultimate objective may include the following stages and measures : ( 1 ) any questions can be discussed during the political negotiations under the premise of one china .
as the first step , the two sides of the strait may first conduct negotiations on the formal end of hostilities .
( 3 ) increasing mutual trust : the chinese people on both sides of the strait are of the same origin , and there is no fundamental conflict of interest between them that cannot be resolved .
but the " two - state " theory is a stumbling block to the development of cross - strait relations .
after the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the chinese nation will certainly be able to usher in a glorious , historical moment of complete reunification of the motherland .
most of the reports are replete with skepticism over this russian strongman .
the united states , however , did not respond in kind to dissolve the military bloc of nato on the basis of the " common values of all mankind . "
following the disintegration of the soviet union , the russian federation again faced the danger of yet another disintegration because of the " phenomenon of chechen , " which is a nation within a nation . "
we should say that russia 's major restructuring of its external security system is a response , which russia is forced to make because of the west 's insatiable , step - by - step moves to squeeze its strategic space , and absolutely not because of russia 's bellicosity .
the fact is that this theory is nothing but a hypocritical subterfuge . who in those developed countries with strong economic growth and lavish consumption habits have given any food to the starving african children struggling on the line of death , basing on the belief that that " human rights take precedence over sovereignty " ?
the first one was britain 's release of chile 's former president , pinochet .
thus , extraditing pinochet to spain would be an extremely complex and sensitive international event , and britain , after considering the issue very carefully , dared not set this dangerous precedence .
the second incidence was : when chechen 's secessionist force was at the critical point where its very existence was at stake , and sought help , even military intervention , from the united states , the us government , while expressing profound sympathies , flatly rejected the request .
the us government has been strongly condemning russian troops for creating a " humanitarian crisis " in chechen .
if the united states chose to act according to the theory that " human rights take precedence over sovereignty , " then it should feel justify to send troops to chechen , just as it did when it invaded yugoslavia during the kosovo war .
but american people fully understand what will be the consequence of their intervention in the chechen war. they fully understand that it is not in the national interests of the united states .
many world events happening after cold war have vividly illustrated this fact , namely : although globalization has had a profound impact on the world , the core of international relations remains politics buttressed by strength and national interests .
while globalization has weakened the traditional national interests , it cannot replace the fundamental national interests .
the wealth of the united states belongs to the united states . the resources in china belong to china . british patents belong to britain .
national interests are still the basic principle that countries all over the world follow in making decisions or taking actions .
in the early winter morning , the great desert seemed sound asleep , and the whole area was in darkness as our cross - country jeep drove in .
inside the jeep we were enjoying the darkness , because no one could find us .
the date was 20 november 1999 , a day written in the glorious annals of the chinese nation .
our vehicle was so close to the launching tower , and we could clearly see the long arms of the shiny green launching tower embracing a milk - white new type of rocket pointing at the sky .
all kinds of thoughts were thronging my mind at the time , but i did not say anything , i was afraid that the others in the vehicle were in a state of anxiety , for this after all was china 's first test - launch of a spaceship .
do not think for a moment that i , a female in the military , am stupidly brave , in fact i " know what 's what " and i am familiar with the veterans in charge of the spaceship 's destiny .
i just wanted to watch the " shenzhou " soar into the heaven from nearby . . .
wang yongzhi [ 3769 3057 1807 ] is the chief designer in china 's manned spaceflight project , and so far the missiles and carrier rockets designed under his charge have never failed .
it is no surprise that chief designer wang attracts young men .
i really admire chief designer wang 's powers of attraction .
sun gongling 's eyes were bright as he said this , as if he had already seen the spacecraft soaring into the sky .
he quickly added something worth pondering : " a man 's attraction lies in his wisdom and boldness . "
that was in june 1964 , when wang yongzhi went to the gobi for the first time to undertake the task of launching the first medium - short - range missiles developed by china itself .
during the test firing , the missile 's range was not long enough .
the experts considered how to add more propellant to the rocket , but as the rocket ' fuel tanks were limited , it was not possible to feed in any more .
just when everyone was racking their brains to think of a solution , a young lieutenant stood up and said : " if the propellant temperature is high when the rocket is launched , its density will be reduced , thus the motor 's throttle characteristic will change accordingly .
after calculation , if 600 kg of fuel are unloaded from the rocket , the missile will hit the target . "
someone said impolitely : " the rocket 's capacity was already insufficient , yet you want to remove some of the fuel ? "
pointing at wang yongzhi , qian xuesen said to the chief designer : " this young man 's opinion is correct , and do as he says ! "
it turned out that the rocket 's range lengthened after some of the propellant was removed , and all the three missiles launched hit the target .
the iron arms on the launch tower opened up , and the long rapier in the crystal palace , outlined against the sky , displayed its heroic posture .
i knew that it would be wang yongzhi controlling the rocket bundle 's " portrait rights . "
on 16 july 1990 when china successfully launched its first rocket bundle at xichang , he had been the chief person responsible for its development .
i concentrated my gaze on a tall and straight rocket ; it contained a great deal of new technology , such as that used for checking and dealing with faults , and it was completely reliable .
the manned spaceflight project has seven major subsystems , and each system has a chief designer and director .
liu zhusheng [ 0491 4554 3932 ] , chief designer of the rocket , jokingly said to me : " chief designer wang has never asked me if the rocket will work properly , i really wanted to tell him that he need not worry , there is no problem with the rocket . "
that day i told wang yongzhi what liu zhusheng had said . gratified , chief wang smiled : " i know liu zhusheng , he is very careful . "
it seemed that the alarm bell needed to ring for a long time .
at this time the launch tower was completely opened up , and the rocket and spacecraft were all displayed before our eyes .
the three - cabin scheme for the spacecraft was proposed by wang yongzhi .
it means : the orbital cabin is the place where the astronauts live and work ; the reentry cabin is the spacecraft 's control center , and the astronauts sit in there during the launch and reentry ; and the propulsion cabin provides energy and power for the spacecraft in orbit and in reentry .
there were different opinions on this .
the spaceflight departments proposed : the risk of sending up a prototype spacecraft is too great , and we should have a good match to be on the safe side .
wang yongzhi went to consult shen rongjun [ 3088 2837 7486 ] : " we should attach a spacecraft to the rocket , but what happens if progress on the spacecraft 's motor lags behind ? "
and for lieutenant general shen rongjun , deputy director of china 's manned spaceflight , the pressure was very heavy , because he strongly advocated that the first launch of the spacecraft must go into space and successfully return .
his decisionmaking choice was related to whether this undertaking would succeed or fail , and he profoundly felt the great difficulty of his task .
this china 's first spacecraft launch .
minister cao gangchuan and political commissar li jinai know their subordinates sufficiently well to delegate appropriate responsibilities to them ; they handed to shen rongjun the heavy task of the manned spaceflight and let him take overall responsibility .
when the jiuquan satellite launch site was starting construction in the late 1950 's , shen rongjun , who had just graduated from university , volunteered to go to the great desert ; by now he has taken part in and directed more than 50 missile tests and rocket and satellite launches .
he is a renowned spaceflight observation and control expert and also a launch controller of great experience .
this means that he shoulders heavy burdens .
on 4 october shen rongjun was told in a urgent phone call from the launch site that there was a problem with a part of the spacecraft 's control system .
the following day he flew to the launch site and immediately convened a technical discussion meeting on whether to open up the craft to carry out crash repairs .
shen rongjun resolutely decided : " we cannot run the risk in space !
so long as the organization is tight , and the measures effective , mistakes on the ground can be avoided . "
i looked toward the launch tower ; the tip of the spacecraft atop the rocket glinted in the dark desert as it moved away from the tower . 13 november , the spacecraft arrives at the launch site .
the road was lined with tall xinjiang poplars standing up fine , straight , and sturdy in the desert , like sentinels guarding a narrow path . they gave people a feeling of exhilaration .
two days previously , i and he had passed neat rows of hot houses covering 150 mu , where cucumbers , tomatoes , peppers and other seasonal vegetables were growing sturdily .
the car stopped in front of a large construction ; the spacecraft was just being transported in the sun to the rocket general assembly and testing plant . we followed behind and entered a brain city .
commander liu introduced them to me in a very familiar way ; it was not at all easy for so many parameters to be accurate , and i was amazed at his memory ; i even wondered whether or not i needed to put so many hard to remember figures into a microcomputer .
liu mingshan is a good talker ; after graduating from university he left for the gobi , and now he has been there 33 years and has witnessed the launch of 33 satellites from the space city plus various types of missiles and carrier rockets .
i took the liberty to ask : " does your wife work here ? "
i remember her with gratitude to the end of my life ! "
at this moment , the winter sunlight was on his face , and i could see tears in his eyes .
he suddenly reproached himself : " she cried out several times that she had stomach pain , why did i not get her to the hospital sooner ? "
seeing what i was thinking , he said quietly : " renjin had stomach cancer .
i can never forget her lying on the sick bed , exhorting me with her last breath : you must get the spacecraft into space . "
that afternoon i went into the space city history museum ; a photograph of liu mingshan 's wife pan renjin was on an honor board ; a senior colonel , she was smiling , and she appeared young and very pretty .
she was an outstanding technical cadre standard - bearer here , and also an outstanding party member , who had won many awards .
her main work here was to monitor the site 's electromagnetic compatibility .
in accordance with pan renjin 's will , her ashes were buried in the dongfeng martyrs mausoleum .
the desert wind blowing outside the mausoleum brings the rockets ' thunder past the neat rows of memorials , and there is peace after the wind has passed ; it is as peaceful as dreamland .
in a man 's life there is a kind of constant remembrance of gratitude , there is one thought that endures for ever , and there is a kind of person who walks alone .
liu mingshan is now alone , he shoulders the important commission of the motherland and people to achieve the hope his wife voiced with the dying breath - - to launch the " shenzhou ! "
i have come over from the hustle of the launching site , and many times i have seen lieutenant general shen rongjun and lieutenant general hu shixiang [ 5170 0013 4382 ] , who is now deputy director of the installation department , directing satellite launches .
however , they have the posture of generals , and they can disguise their feelings and pull through , until the launch has succeeded .
dawn is just breaking over the launch site , and i am happy to see the rocket pointing at the sky ; " good weather , favorable terrain , and friendly people " are all present , and probably nothing frightening will happen .
shen rongjun and hu shixiang exchanged views , then gave the decisive order : " launch according to plan .
later i found out that the four " yuanwang " ships had overcome seven strong typhoons and passed through many complex and dangerous sea areas in steaming a total of 62,000 nautical miles in 259 days , equivalent to three times around the world , and they completely fulfilled their sea monitoring and control tasks .
at 0630 , the great desert trembled , the firmament shook , and orange flames lifted the rocket and the spacecraft with thunderous roar into the sky and into space .
in his view , manned spaceflight is a life project .
in 1997 , the day after completing the task of astronaut selection , he received an order to enter the jiuquan satellite launch center .
on 13 november , i witnessed a huge iron hook installing the spacecraft onto the rocket nose , over 90 meters high !
tense , my hands were sweating .
is there not a saying : the skilled are bold ?
i also saw here xu kejun [ 1776 0344 0193 ] , chief engineer at the launch site .
the article he wrote entitled " china 's future launch sites should have two big technological progress features , " which was published in zairen hangtian [ manned spaceflight ] magazine in 1995 , was praised by china 's famous scientist qian xuesen .
one is 30 years older than the other .
chief designer qi said to yuan jiajun [ 5913 1367 6511 : " i took part in developing china 's first satellite when i was 30 , and you are taking part in directing the development of china 's first spacecraft at the age of 37 . "
chief qi said : " i hope that there will be successors in china 's space flight , with each generation getting stronger . "
he readily replied : " i have a clear idea of the technical plans and have considered them quite carefully .
i will not only fulfill on time the task assigned me by the leadership but will ensure that it exceeds the leadership 's expectations . "
greeting the first dawn of 2000 , a national flag of special significance was hoisted over tiananmen square - - the five - star red flag that flew through space with " shenzhou " fluttered in the first dawn of the new year , to greet new glory for china 's space flight .
in the last 20 years , china 's science and technology research has made achievements which have gained the attention of the people of the world .
in recent years , some domestic departments in charge of scientific research have shown a notably excessive emphasis on evaluating in terms of how many articles are published abroad .
the evaluation of scientific research personnel by many scientific research departments has frequently indiscriminately considered the publishing of one article abroad as equal to publishing one or more articles domestically , resulting to a great degree in attracting chinese academic articles to publishing abroad .
this means that in a period of 15 years , the number of articles published in scientific and technical periodicals domestically in china fell relatively by 26.2 percent .
in addition , the isi database manifests a notable regional disparity in regard to the number of publications sourced in regard to certain regions . the number of publications sourced to certain countries or regions in the isi database is not in conformity with the scientific and technological levels or overall power of certain countries or regions .
if china 's high - level scientific research results are for the most part published in foreign science and technical journals , due to the factors of cost and channels of distribution , it will be difficult to see that these results receive simultaneous first reporting domestically .
in addition , the national commission for natural sciences funding and the chinese science association have begun a joint provision of set amounts of funding to 100 outstanding science and technical periodicals . this definitely will promote the further heightening of the quality of these magazines .
in these respects , china 's domestic publications at present include only a minute number of scientific and technical journals , which are in an initial stage of development and await strengthening .
china 's scientific and technical journals should additionally fully pay attention to publicity and distribution work .
compared with the complete marketing networks and contacts and advanced advertising methods employed by foreign publishers , the level of china 's distribution work for its scientific and technical periodicals is still relatively backward , and this is extremely obvious in the existing 148 english editions of scientific and technical publications .
what is clintonism , and what does it involve ? [ jin yinan ] since monroe was elected president in 1817 , many us presidents have given their name to a " doctrine . "
the new doctrine of " clintonism " has emerged since the gulf war and the breakup of the soviet union .
clinton is the first us president in half a century to have done no military service .
now in the eighth year of his presidency , he has become the president who has issued the greatest number of air strike orders in history .
what she said when sounding off against joint chiefs of staff chairman powell in 1993 has already become a famous saying in us political circles : " you are always talking about our super military forces !
but what is the point of having these forces if we cannot use them ? "
the fiery albright gave the true essence of clintonism : " use these forces , " so that the world will know " the point of possessing them . "
this then is the post - cold war world in us eyes .
clintonism is military hegemonism in a unipolar world , which takes us interventionist policy to the limits .
the unga of september 1999 became a watershed in explaining clintonism .
at the unga , western opinion universally held that the united states would give a comprehensive exposition of clintonism , which was very much in the limelight .
clinton 's address to the unga on 21 september , however , greatly disappointed these people .
this low - key address caused sparse applause among the delegates , in sharp contrast to his address in 1998 , which was followed by a standing ovation .
it was precisely in the kosovo war , the peak of this military intervention , that clinton looked on helplessly at the inability of his doctrine to equal his ambition .
since production of combat planes such as the f-16 has ended , there was a serious shortage of parts for round - the - clock bombing , and there was no alternative but to cannibalize aircraft of this type in the united states as an emergency replenishment .
a shortage of flight personnel meant that they had to fly when already tired , and it was also necessary to urgently mobilize the reserve at home .
a us air force memorandum said : " the combat units are in a difficult period , there are almost no spare engines available , and the combat equipment is almost exhausted . "
during the " missile crisis " on the korean peninsula , the americans acted contrary to their moves in the middle east and europe by seeking in various ways engagement and negotiations with north korea , in a bid for a compromise .
when li teng - hui dished up the " two - state theory , " he expected the americans to pull the chestnuts out of the fire for him , but they resented the retainer turning into the master .
bader , former director of asian affairs in the national security council , said : " we have not undertaken not to stint the blood of american soldiers . "
when will the us military , which is accustomed to using retainers , personally fight in the vanguard on behalf of a retainer ?
this is the objective reason why clintonism can hardly be swayed by people like li teng - hui in asia .
its caution and restraint in asia are also based on the following objective factors : first of all , there is no organization like nato in asia .
although there is the us - japan security treaty , and the 100,000 troops under the us pacific command , it is extremely difficult for the united states to squeeze the countries of the region together and place them under its standard .
since the vietnam war , all us military intervention actions have been essentially characterized by " speed " and " not getting in deep " and have been aimed at weak and small opponents against whom success is easy , and fought in regions where it is easy to break off .
the peoples nurtured by history , nationality , and culture in asia , however , are completely the opposite of the standard opponents imagined by the united states .
third , the greatest obstacle encountered by clintonism in asia is precedent when , far from achieving successful intervention , the united states has encountered serious failure in this region since world war ii .
here it is not so much the " victories " in the gulf and kosovo wars as rather the lessons of the korean and vietnam wars that play the role of historical experience .
as a result , the americans are unable to apply the iraq or kosovo pattern to resolve the problems of this region .
a number of countries with highly developed information technology [ it ] have emerged since the 1980 's , in the wake of the asymmetrical development of the world information field .
they exploit their monopoly status in information resources and the related industries to impose it control , penetrate by means of information resources , and dump information products in countries where it is relatively undeveloped , so as to attain their corresponding political , economic , and military goals .
this is the " information colonialism " phenomenon which this article raises .
it is exported like capital , as an intellectual property right ; the information business has become a new growth point ; and in addition the development of the information industry is unbalanced - - these provide a hotbed for information colonizing .
according to relevant data , in the global information business , the united states accounts for 92 percent of cpu output and 86 percent of systems and parts , and there are now 113 million internet customers .
in this regard , the french complained back in the 1970 's : the entire french databank field is monopolized by the united states ; and in the 1980 's , japan exclaimed : japan may be reduced to the status of america 's " information colony . "
forty percent of the source of modern economic development and growth comes from the information industry .
output value of information industries of many developed western countries accounts for 45 to 60 percent of their gnp , whereas in the developing countries the proportion is only about one percent , the scope is narrow , and the quality is poor .
thus , powerful information countries switch from exporting financial capital to exporting information capital and imposingly occupy the information field in backward countries , thus restricting the development of national information business there .
at the same time they pose a serious threat to the economic security of these countries .
the progress of it has also sparked changes in the world military scene .
it is also connected to a vast databank which collects information on customers , and when required , this databank can provide the customer 's secrets to political , economic , and military organizations .
by means of an internal sequence code , the pentium iii processor can compare the customer with the information that he gathers and decipher the identity and personal secrets of the customer ; or they can deliberately leave an embedded virus , and install hidden dangers such as concealed channels and codes that can recover code keys .
culture is an important foundation in preserving social stability .
the people of a given nation in a given age are living in a certain cultural pattern and cultivate their own human qualities .
norms of language , writing , beliefs , and morals have formed the cultural circle of each country and nation .
in the information age , information has become a major strategic resource , the information industry has become a country 's mainstay industry , information security has become the most important security element , and the information net has become a country 's important strategic infrastructure .
standing at the threshold of the 21 st century , people do not have only feelings of happiness ; it is evident from the uneven economic development and the countless conflicts and turmoil in the 20 th century that high technology is the core of the competition in all - round national strength .
the developed countries have unfolded fierce competition in research and development , centering around " technological hegemony . "
the phenomenon of information colonialism will become an important motive cause in future war .
without information security , there can be no national political , economic , and military security .
when mankind entered the industrial age , the chinese nation had its fill of the bitterness of colonialism and semi - colonialism , and such a state of affairs cannot be restaged when mankind enters the information age .
we must therefore have full rational awareness and strategic countermeasures .
we should establish the concept of standing on our own feet .
we must establish self - defense measures .
on 11 january of this year , the number of patent applications across china topped the 1 - million mark , and thus china has entered the world 's rank of big powers of patent applications .
china 's patent industry has made considerable progress in such areas as patent legislation , patent protection , and training and international exchanges in patent qualified people in a short span of 15 years .
according to a briefing by a relevant responsible person from the state intellectual property rights bureau , the number of patent applications china handled in 1998 and 1999 totaled 121,989 and 134,240 or an increase of 6.8 percent and 10 percent respectively from the previous year .
of the country 's total patent applications , the number of patent applications by scientific research units and institutions of higher learning increased by 7 percent and 22 percent respectively , while that of patent applications by enterprises at home also increased by 6.7 percent and 20 percent respectively .
an expert from the state intellectual property rights bureau stated : having superiority in patents is an important guarantee for gaining the initiative in competition .
achieving a leap in technological development is an important target of china 's scientific and technological progress and technological innovation and also the only way to expedite china 's modernization .
state intellectual property rights office director jiang ying also pointed out : it will help vigorously push technological innovation activities among enterprises , scientific research units , and institutions of higher learning to carry out patent work throughout the entire process of technological innovation .
this being the case , the key to solving the problem of patent quantity lies in improving the scientific and technological level as a whole on which china relies for its patents .
third , the actual protection of intellectual property rights should be enhanced .
to spark the desire of scientists and technicians for innovations , it is very important to implement a paten - rewarding mechanism . this will help form a benign circle in technological innovation activities among enterprises .
the publication and implementation of these numerous policies has thus powerfully mobilized the enthusiasm of the institute 's scientific research personnel for innovations . as china 's entry into the world trade organization is approaching , patent departments in china are facing greater pressures .
therefore , it is all the more necessary to enhance the quality and international competitiveness of patent work , further safeguard national sovereignty and economic security , and promote social progress .
why is it that the daya bay nuclear power station can be ranked among the best nuclear power plants in the world ?
establish the modern enterprise system and successfully probe the way of scientific management of enterprises in which the state has a controlling interest .
the two 1 million kilowatt - class nuclear power generating units of the daya bay nuclear power station are like two " money printing machines " operating around the clock , each of which creates more than $ 1 million in output value every day .
the daya bay nuclear power station earned $ 560 million in foreign exchange and created 2.3 billion yuan in profits and taxes in 1999 .
with such an enormous amount of profits , is the daya bay power station very lavish in spending ?
when briefed by staff of the daya bay power station , the reporters found that the briefing materials they used were printed on both sides while those distributed to us were printed on one side only .
the sense of cost and the extent of meticulous management of the staff of the daya bay power station can be seen from this !
the joint venture company has strict rules , systems , and execution procedures for all its work , from the procurement of staple materials and the suspension , reloading , and overhaul of nuclear power generating units to the distribution of labor insurance goods and small gifts to guests .
degai [ name as transliterated ] , a foreign expert who had worked in the daya bay power station , said that in a certain sense , what the power station produced was not electricity but documents , because everything had rules to follow and was restricted by procedures .
implementation of rules , systems , and work procedures hinges on man .
the influence of the auditing department can be seen everywhere in the daya bay power station .
the joint venture company 's xerox machines were reduced from 53 to 36 last year because the auditing department discovered that the actual volume of copies printed by the company 's xerox machines was lower than the suggested volume of the machine provider , which was a waste of resources .
more than 300 tonnes of substandard concrete iron placed on the work site of the lingao nuclear power station were not transported out . the auditing department issued a notice of correction as soon as it discovered this .
a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts , a protective screen more secure than steel - reinforced concrete nuclear power is a clean and highly efficient source of energy .
however , 100 percent safety should be ensured .
it has established a virtual protective screen more secure than steel reinforced concrete - - a nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts .
on one occasion , leakage of lubricant was discovered on a gas turbine after a grade - seven maintenance worker completed the overhaul of its filter screen .
an inspection showed that an insertion ring was missing .
the worker said that he did not receive the insertion ring , but the power station 's strict system of registration of material inflow and outflow proved the worker was lying .
the maintenance department immediately organized personnel to conduct analysis and study and adopted timely measures to eliminate the hidden danger .
since then , an atmosphere has been established in the power station in which people begin with speaking the truth when they want to correct an error .
it is in such detailed workflow , strict rules and systems , and the sense of safety deeply rooted in workers ' hearts that the nuclear safety culture of the daya bay nuclear power station is reflected .
outside the main control room of the no. 1 generating unit , the reporters saw some banners , reading " do everything successfully at one stroke , make every person a protective screen " and " it is safety not the market that decides everything . "
the nuclear safety culture deeply rooted in people 's hearts has laid a solid foundation for the safe operation of the daya bay nuclear power station .
using the nuclear power station to support nuclear power development and achieving continuous development , the daya bay nuclear power station has become the incubator of guangdong 's nuclear power development .
zan yunlong , the major planner and builder of the daya bay nuclear power station , was appointed chairman of the board of directors and concurrently president of the guangdong nuclear power group company .
by then , the building projects of the lingao nuclear power station had been successfully completed , and the main part of the project entered the period of installation .
in the construction of the lingao nuclear power station , the principle of " putting safety and quality first " has been strictly implemented , and quality , progress , investment control has been exercised across the board to ensure that best quality and efficiency are achieved in construction and equipment .
on the occasion marking the 4 th anniversary of president jiang zemin 's important speech on the taiwan issue , the committee and the relevant central departments jointly held large - scale commemorative forums .
they held forums with relevant responsible persons of seven ministries and commissions , including the state economic and trade commission , to discuss problems discovered in the course of investigation , and offered some suggestions for resolving relevant problems .
the hong kong , macao , taiwan , and overseas chinese committee combined investigation and study with the efforts to help taiwan businessmen eliminate difficulties and anxiety , organized cppcc committee members to visit taiwan - invested enterprises and communicated with relevant departments to solve problems arising with taiwan businessmen 's investments and operations .
many committee members also actively wrote and published articles and participated in activities to criticize the " two - state theory . "
the committee briefed the hong kong , macao , and taiwan personages and overseas chinese on the great achievements of the motherland 's reform and opening up as well as its principles and policies on " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems , " and earnestly listened to their opinions and suggestions .
at the time when the 50 th national day and the cppcc anniversaries were celebrated , this committee also invited and received several hundreds of representatives of hong kong , macao , taiwan and overseas chinese compatriots to beijing to attend celebration activities .
the israeli government claimed that the places israel has raided are bases of the lebanese hezbollah guerrillas and the air raids have been a retaliatory act against hezbollah 's attacks of israel 's " security zone " in southern lebanon which caused injuries and deaths of several israeli soldiers .
israel 's air raids have triggered anger and condemnations among all lebanese .
the lebanese government also submitted a petition letter to un secretary general annan asking the international community to stop israel from repeatedly invading lebanon .
the international community , especially the arab world , also has shown strong concern for israel 's bombings of lebanon 's civilian facilities , causing injuries of civilians , and has criticized one after another israel 's such " reckless invasion act " .
public opinion has widely held that , at the current critical moment when the middle east peace process is facing a trial , israel 's air raids not only have worsened its relations with lebanon , but also will jeopardize the entire middle east region 's peace process .
in 1985 , israel ended its invasive war with lebanon . but , citing need to ensure security in the northern part of its country , israel established in lebanon 's southern border area a " security zone " of more than 1,000 square km .
but , things have turned out to be just the opposite . the bombings not only have not lowered tensions in southern lebanon ; on the contrary , they have deepened hostility between israel and lebanon .
on the night of 8 february , after israel carried out the first round of air raids in the early morning , hezbollah guerrillas claimed that they launched another assault against israel 's " security zone , " killing one israeli soldier and injuring two .
lebanese prime minister huss resolutely said : it is israel that has failed to abide by the cease - fire agreement of understanding reached between the two countries in april 1996 and launched the air raids . but the air raids cannot shake the lebanese people 's determination to resist and attack israel 's occupation .
syria , as an ally of lebanon in opposing israel 's illegal occupation , has made particularly strong responses to israel 's air raids .
in december last year , with us mediation , syria and israel began to resume peace talks .
this undoubtedly has worsened syrian - israeli relations , making the prospects of the peace talks , which already have been at a standstill , even dimmer .
the palestine issue is an important link in the regional peace process .
according to the " sharm el sheikh memorandum " reached between palestine and israel in september last year , the two sides will sign on 13 february this year a framework agreement on the final - status issue and will reach a permanent peace treaty in september this year .
however , over a period that just passed , talks between the two sides on the final - status issue have proceeded very slowly and little progress has been made , and currently they basically are in standstill .
it has been learned that , the united states , france , and other parties concerned have privately initiated diplomatic activities in an effort to prevent the situation in southern lebanon from getting out of control .
balance of rights and obligations an important wto characteristic the wto is one of the three main international economic organizations in the world today , and it plays an important role in spurring world trade liberalization , organizing multilateral trade negotiations , handling international trade disputes , and so on .
all wto accords and articles have been adopted by its members through negotiations and agreed on the basis of reaching unity through consultations .
any member must while enjoying the rights also undertake the corresponding obligations , so that rights and obligations are basically in balance .
the wto legal system is basically composed of basic principles and exceptions to these principles .
on the basis of abiding by the basic principles and carrying out their corresponding obligations , wto members can also , under the necessary conditions , make use of the exclusion clauses to protect their own rights and interests .
according to these clauses , when wto members encounter serious imbalance of international payments , or when economic development requires the government to adopt interventionist policies , and so on , they can temporarily readjust their corresponding obligations in order to ensure their economic stability and development .
trade liberalization , however , has conditions ; the wto permits its members , especially the developing countries , to gradually achieve trade liberalization in line with their own economic and trade situation and competitiveness , to facilitate the provision of opportunities for their domestic industrial restructuring .
if trade disputes occur between wto members , they can have recourse to the disputes settlement mechanism , and these will be adjudicated by specially composed groups of experts ; the adjudication has the force of compulsion , and all members whatever their size must be constrained by it and execute it .
this has to a very great extent changed the situation in which major treading nations dominated dispute settlement , and gives a certain degree of protection to the interests of developing countries .
at present there are 135 members of the wto , and developing countries and regions account for 81 percent of membership .
uphold balance between rights and obligations when china joins the wto beginning in 1986 , in its 14 - year negotiating process for rejoining gatt and joining the wto , china has consistently upheld the principle of balancing rights and obligations .
generally speaking , the obligations carried out should correspond to the rights enjoyed ; we will not accept a price that exceeds what we can bear , but must achieve balance of rights and obligations .
since the launch of reform and opening up , china 's all - round national strength has increased , and its impact on world economy and trade has continually expanded ; the wto is incomplete without china 's participation , nor does such a situation benefit world economic development .
in the negotiations for china to rejoin gatt and join the wto , we have consistently upheld the principle that china is a developing country , and that we can only join the wto under the conditions for developing countries .
for instance , during the transition period , taking information technology products as an example , developed countries need to lower their tariffs to zero by 2000 , while for developing countries the period can be extended until 2005 .
thus the results of the negotiations will ultimately benefit china 's reform and opening up and help to preserve our economic security .
china 's accession to the wto , its observance of wto rules , and its execution of the obligations on market opening which we have given in the negotiations will provide still better and still more stable opportunities for other countries and regions to gain entry into our market .
regarding the question of the balance of rights and obligations in china 's accession to the wto , we must uphold dialectical materialism and look at it from the viewpoint of development ; rights and obligations are not immutable .
after china joins the wto , we must become familiar with and grasp its rules as quickly as possible , and change to the maximum the rights that we enjoy into actual interests for promoting our economic development .
he said the agricultural restructuring will be market - oriented , the objective is to improve the quality and returns of agricultural goods , and the restructuring will proceed in farming , animal husbandry , and aquaculture all at the same time .
to succeed in adjusting the agricultural structure , chen yaobang said : first of all , we will adjust the farming structure .
with respect to regional layouts , coastal areas in the east and outskirts of large and medium cities will develop modern agriculture to produce export - oriented agricultural goods .
these areas will eventually become bases that export quality agricultural products .
areas in central china , to give play to their high productivity of food grain , will establish large , efficiently managed bases that produce commercial grain and process grain for feed and other purposes .
eastern china and the outskirts of large cities will actively develop production of scale .
they will also develop intensive processing of livestock products and speed up the pace of modernizing their animal husbandry .
third , we will continue to optimize the structure of fishing operations .
we will strictly control the their intensity and continue to enforce the " zero growth " plan .
bangkok , 13 feb - - the tenth united nations conference on trade and development [ unctad ] was convened on 12 th february in bangkok , thailand .
it marked the first global economic meeting of the new century and was convened under circumstances of stepped up economic globalization , further widening of gap between the rich and poor and north and south , and strong urge from the developing countries to establish a new international economic order .
at the meeting 's inaugural ceremony , people could not forget the unpleasant and fruitless minister - level wto meeting in seattle in the united states at the end of last year .
the result of that meeting fully demonstrated the heightened conflict between the developing and the developed countries in the ways they handled global economic affairs .
the progress in science and technology and information technology has accelerated the global exchange of commodities , manpower , capital , talent , and markets ; this trend of economic globalization will prevail .
judging by today 's situation , economic globalization not only has accelerated global economic development but also has widened the gap between the rich and the poor worldwide .
therefore in the course of economic globalization , it is essential to promptly set up a fair and reasonable new international economic order to remedy the defects brought by the globalization process .
development is another issue facing the conference on trade and development , and as far as the developing countries are concerned , development naturally is the number one issue .
today , the developing countries as a whole have become the source of world economic growth , but fund shortages , backward technologies , lack of qualified management personnel , poor infrastructure , and other problems are seriously hampering the developing countries ' economic growth .
he pointed out : price regulation and control in 2000 should not only strive to bring about an appropriate and rational pickup in the overall price level to boost the confidence of investors and consumers in the market , but also pay attention to monitoring and controlling any signs of excessive price hikes that may occur in some areas .
he pointed out : it is necessary to intensify the reform of prices and fees this year and let prices that are suitable for decontrolling be determined by the supply and demand in the marketplace in a timely manner .
though they are not in great numbers , they do have a major impact on the national economy .
this responsible person said : steps will be taken this year to set about studying how to reform the price formation mechanism in these industries .
for example , competitive grid entry prices will be introduced on an experimental basis in the power industry to restrain the construction investment and operating costs of power plants .
the reform of the rural electricity price control system and the transformation of the rural power grid will be accelerated , introducing the same price on the same grid for both urban and rural areas in phases and in batches .
the price formation mechanism for crude oil and finished oil products shall be perfected to encourage oil and petrochemical companies to engage in rational competition .
china 's civil aviation industry has achieved sustained , high - speed growth since the reform . however , the chinese civil aviation industry 's major indices are extremely low in proportion to the world totals .
china 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .
in 1997 , proceeds from general aviation only accounted for 0.3 percent of the income of caac - affiliated enterprises .
the civil aviation industry is one of the emerging industries that are capital - and high - technology - intensive and have the greatest potential for development and is also one of the most important industries with a considerable spillover effect .
government administration remains integrated with enterprise management the civil aviation industry is one of the few industries in present - day china that still retain the planned economy 's characteristic of integrating government administration with enterprise management .
it is necessary to accelerate the transformation of civil aviation administrative departments ' functions .
however , china has followed a trend contrary to the development of the world civil aviation industry which sees a constant rise in the unit cost of transportation that causes a corresponding rise in the unit price of transportation .
china 's airfare per passenger kilometer is fairly high by world standards and , still more , extremely expensive in relation to its level of per capita gdp or per capita consumption expenditure . the development of the civil aviation industry not only has not benefited society at large but instead has increased trading costs throughout society .
first , it is necessary to make an early , rational division between military , civilian , and military - civilian joint controls of the air .
fourth , it is necessary to encourage competitive civil aviation enterprises in the country to engage in strategic cooperation and alliance with transnational civil aviation companies .
in order to implement jiang zemin 's directive , a beijing insider disclosed , zhongnanhai has worked out specific plans for the work in 2000 , which include the following : first , it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political building of the leading bodies , strictly administer the party , and exercise management over the leading cadres .
second , it is necessary to step up reform of state enterprises and on the whole put an end to enterprise deficits and turn deficits into profits .
third , it is necessary to step up the building of the legal system , earnestly rule the country by law , and resolutely correct and punish the practices and individuals involved in meddling in the legal system .
viewed from the working plans , figures from beijing 's political circles believe that there will be new progress in this year 's anticorruption struggle .
the attack on sects will be equated with that on hostile forces , which means that china will not soften its measures towards the sects because of us hegemonist meddling .
more than a month ago , the chinese government resumed the exercise of its sovereignty over macao .
this is a great event of the chinese nation , which happened after hong kong 's return to the motherland , marking a new stage in the great cause of the reunification of the motherland .
the solving of the taiwan issue has been placed more prominently before us .
the number of taiwan compatriots who traveled to the mainland via macao by air exceeded 2 million . the compatriots coming and leaving the mainland via macao had exceeded 3 million .
the 8 - point proposal is the inheritance of these principles and planning in the new situation .
the " one country , two systems " principle was first put forward for resolving the taiwan issue , but it was first put into practice in hong kong .
the steady transition of macao and the smooth handover of power is another successful practice of the " one country , two systems " concept .
at present , the msar government headed by edmund ho hau wah is properly operating administration according to law .
the principle of " one country , two systems " is applicable to hong kong and macao , as well as to taiwan .
the issues of hong kong and macao are historical questions that resulted from foreign colonialist aggression against and occupation of china .
the issues of hong kong and macao were resolved through the diplomatic means of negotiation .
president jiang 's 8 - point proposal sincerely calls for conducting negotiations on peaceful reunification between the two sides of the strait on the premise of the one china principle , on which any question can be discussed .
since china could hold talks with the united kingdom and portugal and successfully resolve the questions of hong kong and macao , why ca n't the fraternal brothers across the taiwan straits hold talks and seek a common understanding ?
with the deepening of the great practice of " one country , two systems " and the dispelling of differences through negotiations , the " one country , two systems " policy , which is the best option , will eventually win the understanding of the vast number of taiwan compatriots .
thanks to the cross - strait air service introduced by macao airlines , macao 's role as an important channel between the two sides of the taiwan straits has become more prominent .
regarding taiwan institutions and personnel in macao , they are requested to abide by the macao basic law and not to engage in activities contravening the one china principle .
for a long time in the past , people of various circles and social organizations in macao , in the activities of contacts and exchanges between macao and taiwan , have done a great deal of work for promoting the peaceful reunification of the mainland and taiwan .
in his important speech on taiwan , president jiang spoke highly of the contribution made by hong kong and macao compatriots and the chinese nationals abroad .
we believe that macao compatriots with a glorious tradition of patriotism will make continued efforts to actively participate in the various tasks for the application of the " one country , two systems " , devote their resources to the steady development of macao and play a still greater role in developing cross - strait relationship .
the application of the " one country , two systems " in macao has exerted positive influence on taiwan .
in the springtime of the year of the dragon , flower - decked shenzhen is imbued with a joyful and celebratory atmosphere .
today this place has become one of the mainland 's largest ocean - going container freight ports .
li peng endorsed the success of the port in construction and operations , and expressed the hope that the port will play a still more positive role in stimulating economic development in shenzhen and south china .
the first stage of the lingao nuclear power plant ( that is , no . 2 ) is proceeding smoothly , and the work has switched from foundation work to installation .
li peng said that guangdong nuclear power has achieved great success in recent years , and i hope you will continue to work hard and do still better .
speaking on the development of guangdong nuclear power , li peng said that care must be taken to build the no . 2 plant project and ensure it is up to the mark in quality and capacity .
we are relatively familiar with and have relatively abundant experience in and mastery of the type of reactor and technology of the daya bay plant .
high - tech industry is the industry with greatest development prospects in shenzhen ; last year output value of these industries was 8.1979 trillion yuan [ as received ] , accounting for 40.5 percent of total industrial output value .
in developing high - tech industries , apart from factors such as funds , technology , and talent , it is also necessary to have a good mechanism ; the government 's role in macroeconomic regulation and control is also extremely important in marked economy conditions .
the course of shenzhen 's development has been unusual ; it is the result of the guidance of deng xiaoping theory , the correct leadership of the cpc central committee with comrade jiang zemin as the core , and the common efforts of the 4 million people of shenzhen .
li peng also pointed out that the more the economy develops , the more necessary it is to administer the city according to law .
the state has granted shenzhen local legislative powers , and shenzhen must take advantage of this strong point to do still better in administering the city according to law .
at the close of , he arrived at the jiuquan satellite launch center to undertake science and technology work after graduating from the university .
china 's space industry can be described as the model of development of china 's national industry .
chairman shen had the good fortune to participate in the early planning of our country 's manned space flight project .
now and again , he became excited when talking about the successful launch and recovery of the shenzhou experimental spacecraft .
he said : the manned space flight project is a massive and complicated systematic project that concentrates today 's high and new technologies . at present , only the united states and russia have the ability to conduct manned space flights .
our country 's complete success in the first launch of the experimental manned spacecraft is yet another miracle created by the chinese nation , which relies totally on its own intelligence and wisdom , and again proved that china 's space industry - - a rising national industry - - has exuberant vitality .
funds for the foundation have mainly come from voluntary donations from china 's and overseas enterprises , groups , and individuals that show concern for and support the development of china 's space undertakings .
the foundation will make wholehearted contributions to strengthen the connections , links , and understanding between china 's space industry and national enterprises , and enable china 's space industry and national enterprises to soar together .
the successful launch and return of the china - designed " shenzhou " spacecraft last october marked a major historic breakthrough in china 's technology for manned space missions .
when the good news reached our company , we felt a deep sense of pride for china 's space scientists , who relied on their own efforts to scale this world pinnacle of technology . this encouraged and inspired us to work harder and make contributions at our respective posts .
with the rapid development of economic globalization and knowledge economy today , competition of overall national strength is essentially a competition of technological innovation .
an important reason why we have been able to score such a splendid achievement in space technology is that we persist in technological innovation and are committed to conquering the frontiers of high technology in the world .
we are deeply aware of this when we look back over the course of our company 's development over the past few decades .
the nanjing automation company , ltd. of the china power company is the first listed high - tech company of the state electric power system .
our products have all entered the international market and have achieved eye - catching results in china 's foreign - aid projects .
chi haotian , who is inspecting work in nanjing military region [ mr ] , thanked her for bringing up a good son and sending a good soldier to the people 's army , saying she is worthy of the title " model mother in loving the country and supporting the army . "
after her husband died of illness , she endured all kinds of hardships to raise her son and then sent him to the army after he grew up .
chi haotian told ji rongzhen : you and your son 's advanced deeds have aroused strong responses in the entire army and nation . i am deeply moved by your patriotism and your support of the army .
all officers and men should learn from you and your son .
since he became ill , he has received care and help from the army and all sectors of society in every possible way .
without the love of the army and society , he could not have lived today . i am sincerely grateful to the party and the army !
nanjing mr commander liang guanglie and political commissar fang zuqi joined chi haotian in comforting ji rongzhen .
it is necessary to purposefully carry out an education in patriotism , collectivism , and socialism to help the students cultivate correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .
it is necessary to actively organize the students to participate in community service and social practice , improve their social experience , and cultivate their hard - working spirit and indomitable will .
it is necessary to actively conduct mental health education to help and guide the students in cultivating good moral character and behavioral habits and to enable them to handle well any contradictions and problems they encounter with respect to study , job skill training , job hunting , and interpersonal relationships . 3 .
greater efforts should be made to reduce the excessive burden of middle and primary school students and ensure success in this regard .
now , some students ' class work is too heavy , yielding great psychological pressure on them . this will not help young students to grow up healthy and sound ; instead , it tends to create problems in various areas .
starting immediately after this spring term begins , all middle schools and primary schools must resolutely abolish the practice of publishing students ' test score rankings . 4 .
it is necessary to strengthen the teacher ranks and constantly improve the teachers ' ideological , political and professional quality .
a determination must be made to improve order in schools and the public order surrounding schools , resolutely combat crimes that harm young students ' healthy growth , and ensure that the students have a quiet , harmonious , and healthy study environment .
president jiang also expounded this ideology in detail in the report to the subsequent 15 th party congress ( 1997 ) and in a speech given at the new year tea party held by the chinese people 's political consultative conference .
the words " all the more " fully reflect that we have paid attention to and respected the opinions and role of the taiwan people .
in other words , in addition to allowing taiwan compatriots to reflect their views of developing cross - strait relations and realizing reunification at any time to the party and government , they may also be allowed to participate in the cross - strait talks .
it can be said that each policy relaxation of the taiwan authorities on cross - strait relations and exchanges was the result of the taiwan compatriots ' contention . it is a fact seen by all that the taiwan authorities ' mainland policy has always been pulled forward by the taiwan people .
taiwan compatriots are also the core force opposing separation and " taiwan independence . "
the relevant taiwan authorities have conducted many opinion polls to support their policies and proposals on splittism .
regarding these polls , only by making in - depth analysis can we see through the appearance to perceive the essence .
this fully demonstrates our utter sincerity for bringing about peaceful reunification .
that " taiwan independence " would only lead to war is not alarmist talk .
compatriots on the both sides of the strait should unite to oppose division , stop the plot for " taiwan independence , " and join efforts to strive for a bright prospect of peaceful reunification .
during the current " vacuum period " wherein there is no way to contain china , enhancing its relations with taiwan , particularly military cooperation , is undoubtedly a kind of restraint on china .
this is of course also a product of internal struggle within the united states .
the passage of the " taiwan security enhancement act " bill by the us house is exactly a " major achievement " of the " money diplomacy " taiwan has promoted in the past years .
we hope the us government will keep its promise and take resolute action , and that it will proceed from the overall situation of sino - us relations and sensibly handle its relations with taiwan . it should avoid losing the greater for the less , spinning a cocoon around itself , and playing with fire and getting burned .
stimulated by these two major favorable measures , the shenzhen and shanghai stock markets rose strongly on the very first trading day of the year of dragon , opening with an exceptionally huge upward gap and going all the way up under an extremely lively market atmosphere .
funds raised through the stock market grew from the 5 billion yuan in 1992 to 130 billion yuan in 1997 and more than 150 billion yuan in 1999 .
the number of listed companies grew from a dozen or so before 1992 to more than 900 in late 1999 , with the market capitalization peaking at over 3.1 trillion yuan in just a matter of a few years .
it can be said that the chinese stock market has developed by leaps and bounds over the past decade to become an emerging market that has drawn worldwide attention .
in recent years , the chinese government has been taking measures to promote the development of the stock market .
with the implementation of a new mode of stock issue , secondary market investors may participate in new stock subscription , based on the market value of their holdings of securities in circulation on the market .
the secondary market used to have a " phobia of new stock issue " in the past because every new stock issue would mean a dilatation and every time there was a dilatation secondary market stock prices would fall and result in a lacklustre market , which would in turn adversely affect new stock issues .
when the new measure is implemented , investors , out of the hope of enjoying the huge price difference between the primary and secondary markets , will actively buy existing stocks before a new stock issue to increase their holdings , thereby increasing their rate of winning the stock allotment lot .
the borrower shall be the head office of a comprehensive securities company , while the lender shall be a solely state - owned commercial bank or any of its authorized branch offices or the head office of other commercial banks .
with this move , securities companies will have more relaxed funding in the days to come and this will be beneficial to their operations in the secondary market .
the new procedures also stipulate that the term of a stock collateral loan shall be six months at the most and that the loan to stock collateral ratio , which is the ratio of the loan principal to the stock collateral 's market value , shall not exceed 60 percent .
any violations of these provisions shall be subject to corresponding punitive measures .
furthermore , this will draw stock investment funds from various quarters , such as enterprises dealing in " third - category commodities , " that have been looking on from the sidelines , thereby increasing capital inflow into the secondary market .
in his letter to li zhaoxing dated on 9 february , helms said he was " aghast " at the remarks made by minister liu xiaoming of the chinese embassy at a news conference on 3 february on the passing of tsea by the house of representatives .
he asked ambassador li zhaoxing to " clarify " liu xiaoming 's remarks that the consequences would be more serious than lee teng - hui 's us visit if the tsea is passed by the us congress .
he said : china has always strongly opposed to the tsea and it has made no attempt to conceal this stand .
first , the bill negates the important " one china " principle and undermines the basic framework of the normalization of china - us ties by treating taiwan as a state .
second , it violates us pledges under the three sino - us joint communiques by calling on the us to greatly upgrade its military ties with taiwan and increase its arms sales .
li zhaoxing said : some congressmen did not have adequate knowledge of the origin of the taiwan issue and the evolution of sino - us relations , especially the us pledge on this issue in the three sino - us joint communiques .
it is hoped that everybody has an even clearer understanding of the situation , and has a clear understanding of their sacred mission as well as the important role of science and technology training of troops in raising combat effectiveness .
we must do well in learning high technology and new knowledge by persisting in a hierarchical and prioritized manner . we must stress putting knowledge into practice , and realize conversion of knowledge into higher standards and conversion of technological potential into actual combat effectiveness .
we must exert vigorous efforts to form systems and combat effectiveness out of new equipment , thereby giving full play to the operational effectiveness of new equipment .
the requirement of " better to let talent wait for equipment than to let equipment wait for talent " raised by chairman jiang zemin must be implemented among military units .
zhang wannian said : we must continue to exert efforts in upholding a scientific spirit and a pragmatic attitude .
at present , we must further straighten the guiding thought in science and technological training of troops , conscientiously do a good job of making plans , set hierarchies rationally , handle the relationship between common and individual characteristics correctly , as well as strengthen planning guidance and training management .
beijing , 15 feb ( xuinhua ) - - using foreign capital is an important aspect of china 's opening - up policy .
insufficient domestic funds have been made up by utilizing foreign capital ; this has increased the state tax revenue and foreign exchange earnings , promoted economic restructuring and the optimization of the industrial structure , accelerated the blending of china 's economy with the world economy , and created a large number of job opportunities .
our country actually used $ 40.4 billion of foreign capital in 1999 . though we maintained a certain scale in this regard , the utilization of foreign capital dropped by 12.8 percent compared with the previous year ; it was the first negative growth rate in recent years .
in addition to the impact of the asian financial crisis , an important cause was that we still did not quite adapt ourselves to the trend of change in the form of direct international investment .
now , more than half of direct global investments have been made in the form of merger and acquisition by transnational enterprises , and over 90 percent of such mergers and acquisitions have taken place in developed countries .
some of the service markets in our country have a tremendous potential , which are very attractive to foreign businessmen , and they will become new hot places to attract foreign businessmen .
then , we should make vigorous efforts to attract famous transnational corporations to invest in china and encourage such corporations to set up research and development centers here in order to expedite technological progress and industrial upgrading .
shanghai municipality , the largest industrial city in our country , now takes attracting the investment of transnational corporations as the focal point of its work in inviting businessmen from the outside to invest in the municipality .
those projects in which they have invested is large in scale , high in technological content , and strong in competition . this has raised shanghai 's entire level of using foreign capital and sped up the development of new and high - tech industries .
the shenzhen special economic zone has gone all out to encourage processing - trade enterprises to shift to high - tech processing ; now in shenzhen , high - tech processing trade has become a new hot place in which foreign businessmen have been investing .
beijing , 15 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today : china attaches importance to and is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the g - 8 .
at a news conference held by the ministry of foreign affairs today , zhu bangzao again stressed this issue further .
he said : china hopes that the g-8 can play an active role in enhancing international cooperation and promoting stable and balanced world economic development , particularly in narrowing the gap between the south and the north .
zhu bangzao pointed out : china has always advocated that consultation , coordination , and decision - making on global issues should have wide representation .
when discussing global issues , it is necessary to listen more to opinions of other countries , especially those from the developing countries .
the spokesman pointed out : china attaches importance to the role played by the g-8 and has always maintained contact with the g - 8 .
it is universally known that china has built its navy mainly by making self - reliant efforts , with imported foreign equipment as a supplement .
people still remember the grand troop review , which was held on 1 october last year to mark the 50 th founding anniversary of the prc . the navy 's three unarmed formations , four missile formations , and two flight echelon formations participated in the parade .
the appearance of the marines in a formation was of particular significance because it was the first time the marines participated in the grand troop review . the formations formed by the marines as well as other naval branches showed the world for the first time a complete force structure of the chinese navy .
meanwhile , the invisibility requirement has also been taken into consideration while designing a warship .
china also has developed " 53h2 - type " guided missile escort ships , which are equipped with " three defenses " capability and an electronic war system .
in addition to acquiring new chinese - built warships and submarines , china also has tried to greatly increase its navy 's operational capability by purchasing the most advanced warships and military equipment of the world .
these missiles , which fly at an altitude of about one meter above sea level , are very difficult for radar to detect .
about 85 percent of major battleships and naval air force pilots participated in the drills . as a result , naval units have acquired training under conditions similar to a real combat situation .
beijing , 15 feb ( xinhua ) - - at 4:00 this afternoon , a man killed himself in the southeast part of tiananmen square by detonating an explosive .
according to investigations by public security , the dead man was li xiangshan , a mental patient from hubei province .
he said : it is the common aspiration of all mankind to prevent the employment of weapons and an arms race in outer space .
as for the so - called " sino - russian joint opposition to an arms race in outer space , " zhu bangzao said clearly that it is inaccurate .
he said : countries that oppose an arms race in outer space are definitely not only limited to china and russia .
this fully reflects the common aspiration and pressing demand of the international community .
he expressed the hope that the conference on disarmament in geneva , as the only multilateral disarmament negotiating forum , should make new contributions to the negotiations and conclusion of international legal articles on the prevention of an arms race in outer space .
hu also sought interests for others who had offered him bribes on many an occasion by taking advantage of his position and had thereby caused huge losses to the state property .
besides , hu failed to identify legitimate resources for his wealth worth more than 1.61 million , which had obviously outstripped his legitimate income .
with the penalties added together , the court decided to carry out the execution of hu ; deprive hu of political rights for life ; and confiscate all hu 's property .
hu 's case of accepting and offering bribes and failing to identify sources of a huge amount of wealth is an extremely serious economic crime case involving a senior leading cadre . the way his crime , one of serious nature , was committed was absolutely vile and has exerted a pernicious influence in the society .
thanks to the cooperation of the relevant departments and the jiangxi provincial cpc committee , the central discipline inspection commission investigated and verified in a timely fashion hu 's serious problems of violating the disciplines and the law and handed hu over to the judicial organs for punishment in accordance with the law .
on 1 february of this year , jiangxi province 's nanchang city people 's procuratorate instituted legal proceedings against hu and accused him of the crime of accepting bribes , the crime of offering bribes , and the crime of failing to identify sources of a huge amount of wealth .
hu had entrusted two counsels to defend him in the court .
the trial of hu changqing 's case has fully enshrined the socialist principle of rule of law that all offenders are equal before the law and has fully demonstrated the party 's and state 's resolve to severely penalize corruption in accordance with the law .
zhu bangzao pointed out emphatically : the chinese government has agreed to taiwan being an independent customs area of china , and under the name of independent customs area of taiwan , penghu , kinmen and matsu , taiwan should enter the wto following china 's accession to the organization .
according to reports , china and the wto members have reached an agreement on that issue , reflected in the council chairman statement of the 1992 general agreement on tariff and trade .
in the meantime , he also explicitly pointed out that foreign minister tang 's visit to iran will not involve military cooperation between the two countries .
zhu bangzao said : during his visits , foreign minister tang will extensively exchange views with leaders of the four countries on further strengthening bilateral relations as well as on international and regional issues of common concern , to achieve the objective of enhancing mutual understanding , deepening friendship , widening consensus , and promoting cooperation .
when answering a reporter 's relevant question , the spokesman explicitly pointed out that foreign minister tang 's visit to iran will not involve military cooperation between the two countries .
now the relations between china and iran are very friendly .
he indicated that foreign minister tang 's visit to iran will make a positive contribution to the further development of the two countries ' friendly cooperative relations .
in replying to a reporter 's question at a news conference of the ministry of foreign affairs today , zhu bangzao said : as a sovereign country , china has the right to take measures to enhance its national defense capabilities .
he pointed out : sino - russian military cooperation is aimed at strengthening national defense and safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity .
strobe talbott , us deputy secretary of state , will lead a delegation to attend the meeting .
during the meeting , both sides will exchange opinions by focusing on such issues as global and regional security situation , ballistic missile defense , and us arms sales to taiwan .
foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao also said at the foreign ministry news conference held on 15 february : at the invitation of chairman li peng , speaker yildirim akbulut of the turkish grand national assembly will lead a delegation of the turkish grand national assembly on an official goodwill visit to china from 20 to 24 february .
in addition , at the invitation of the government of the republic of croatia , zhu lilan , chinese minister of science and technology , will leave for croatia on 16 february as the special envoy of the chinese government to attend the inauguration ceremony of new croatian president stjepan mesic on 18 february .
beijing , 15 feb (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today that while being concerned about the attacks on us and japanese websites , china also objects to any form of bad behavior on the internet .
he said that the chinese government is very concerned about this incident .
he said : as the network economy is one of the important factors promoting a country 's sustained economic growth , network security is of particular importance .
when amending its criminal law in 1999 , china added explicit provisions to the criminal punishment on illegal intrusion into important areas of the computer information system .
zhu bangzao remarked : the relevant department of the chinese government is actively taking effective measures to really safeguard network security .
any bad behavior on the internet is not welcome .
beijing , 15 feb ( xinhua ) - - the utilization of foreign capital constitutes an important content of china 's opening up policy .
but in the face of new challenges brought about by the new trend of international capital flow , china needs new ideas on utilizing foreign capital in the future .
last year , the real amount of foreign capital used by china approached $ 40.4 billion . although the amount still maintained a certain scale , it decreased by 12.8 percent as compared with 1998 , representing the first negative growth in recent years .
first , it was affected by the asian financial crisis . another important reason is that china is not yet quite able to adjust itself to the current trend in the practice of international direct investment .
at present , more than 50 percent of direct investment in the world is carried out in a form of acquisition mergers by multinational enterprises . more than 90 percent of such mergers have occurred in advanced countries .
these new changes have ushered in new challenges for china in its efforts to attract foreign capital .
the markets of some service sectors in china have a great potential . these sectors , which have an extremely strong power to attract foreign businessmen , will become new hot spots for attracting their investment .
moreover , great efforts should be made to invite famous multinational companies to invest in china . besides , we should encourage these enterprises to establish research and development centers in china in a bid to accelerate technological progress and industrial upgrading .
at present , 254 of 500 biggest companies in the world have entered shanghai . the amount of contracted foreign capital for their projects has reached $ 9.3 billion .
meanwhile , great efforts should be made to attract foreign capital in the higher grade processing trades .
china has two advantages to attract foreign capital . first , it has tremendous market potential . second , it has a comparatively cheap labor force .
generally speaking , china has made continuous efforts to improve its investment environment . among developing countries , china is still a country with the greatest power to attract foreign capital .
in light of the need for the development of a national economy and the promises it has made for wto entry , china will open wider to the outside world . particularly , it will open up such service sectors as banking , insurance , telecommunications , foreign trade , commerce , and tourism in a systematic way .
these are moves that will provide a fine external environment for expanding the utilization of foreign capital in a positive and effective way .
recently , the chinese people cannot but express strong indignation at and firm opposition to the " taiwan security enhancement act " (tsea) bill passed by the us house of representatives .
this is a very dangerous political act on the part of the anti - china us forces in its attempt to permanently split china and undermine the great cause of china 's reunification .
once the bill becomes law , it will only incite " taiwan independence " forces into making reckless moves , thereby greatly increasing the possibility of cross - strait and sino - us military conflict and bringing disastrous consequences to sino - us relations .
the main purpose of the bill , which is divided into six sections , is to supplement and further implement the " taiwan relations act " and enhance the united states ' military commitments to taiwan .
the " tsea " bill is the second legal document regulating us - taiwan relations following the " taiwan relations act. "
when the time comes , whether or not taiwan joins the tmd system , the united states and taiwan have entered a quasi - alliance . once events happen in the taiwan strait , the law will provide a legal basis for us armed intervention .
pro - taiwan us congressmen made unwarranted charges against the government 's taiwan policy after president clinton , during his visit to china , openly pledged for the first time to pursue the us " three nos " policy on taiwan .
since last year , more than 30 of 80 anti - china proposals have been adopted by the house of representatives alone .
the passage of the " tsea " bill by the house has demonstrated that anti - china figures in the united states wanted to take the bill as a new force to contain china .
such containment can also serve as a bargaining chip in developing relations with the mainland .
since entering and hosting the white house seven years ago , the democratic party has not done anything that its opponent can hold against it in terms of economy , fiscal deficits , education , employment , and social welfare . the only thing with which the republican party can garner votes is clinton 's china policy .
according to us media reports , one of the major backstage promoters of the smooth passage of the " tsea " bill was cassidy and associates , the us - based public relations firm commissioned by taiwan .
an internal document of the us department of justice showed that the service fees taiwan paid cassidy and associates rose by 37 percent from january to june 1999 alone .
the document pointed out that a key figure responsible for promoting the adoption of the bill - - gejdenson , ranking democratic member of the house of representatives committee on international relations - - received political contributions five times from cassidy and associates in march 1999 alone .
in fact , since the signing of the sino - us " 17 august communiqu , " the united states has never halted arm sales to taiwan . moreover , in recent years , the quantity of the weapons it sold to taiwan has increased dramatically , while their functions and quality have been constantly enhanced .
to placate the congress soon after the release of the " 17 august communiqu , " the united states announced that it agreed to cooperate with taiwan again in making 30 f-5e and f-5f fighters .
the following year the united states sold taiwan military equipment worth $ 500 million , including 60 f-104 fighters .
while in office , clinton first set a precedent by allowing lee teng - hui and other senior taiwan officials and military officers to visit the united states . in 1996 , he provided military support for lee teng - hui 's presidential campaign .
they fight each other in the form of making a fuss together or playing a duet .
the fundamental interests of the us congress and the government are identical . they are only adopting different means and measures .
in short , when china takes military actions , the united states might assist taiwan . even though the united states wins the war , taiwan will be destroyed in flames of war . there is another implication in oksenberg 's remarks .
in other words , if united states enters the war against china , it will lose its current hegemonist position in the world no matter who wins the war .
therefore , the act does not conform to the interests of the united states and taiwan .
recently , president clinton and secretary of state madeleine albright respectively have issued a statement stressing that the us government will eventually veto the act .
history has proven that the chinese people never waver in their determination to safeguard the reunification of their motherland . it is extremely dangerous for anyone to try to go one step beyond the limit .
if this aggravates tension in the taiwan strait and sparks a war , the united states will not be able to shirk its responsibility for it in history .
a source from beijing said that a central department conveyed a document to the officials at and above the ministerial and commission level , referring the event to xinjiang terrorist activities .
as beijing enters the annual period of the march sessions of the national people 's congress and chinese people 's political consultative conference , armed police and security personnel in beijing are on full alert . witnesses say that " level three alert " measures were adopted at the xinhua gate of zhongnanhai near changan avenue .
a political bureau meeting scheduled for today is likely to present a report on the latest progress on the event , the source said .
public security personnel who first arrived at the site used mats to cover the dead bodies .
tiananmen square was unsealed two and a half hours later .
in the more than 20 years since the launch of reform and opening up , china 's socialist construction has achieved successes which have caught the attention of the whole world .
at present , china 's reform and opening up and modernization are in a key period of carrying on the cause and forging ahead into the future .
internationally , economic globalization is developing rapidly , science and technology are progressing by leaps and bounds , and economic ties between countries are unprecedentedly close and their influence on each other is increasing .
joining the wto will have a profound impact on china 's socioeconomic development and on reform and opening up .
as a result of eight rounds of multilateral negotiations held by the wto and its predecessor , gatt , its member states have greatly lowered their tariff barriers , and this has stimulated the development of international trade and world economy to a tremendous extent .
in the past half century , the weighted average tariff level of the developed countries has dropped from about 40 percent in 1948 to about 3.8 percent at present . the weighted average tariff level of the developing countries has now dropped to about 14 percent .
third , to settle trade disputes between members .
the wto 's dispute settlement mechanism plays an important role in ensuring the effective implementing of wto agreements and settling trade disputes between members , thereby creating a stable environment for the smooth development of international trade .
more and more wto members , especially developing countries , have started to make use of the dispute settlement mechanism ; from the establishment of the wto in 1995 to the end of november 1999 , the wto had taken on 144 complaints , 39 of which have now been settled .
joining the wto and further expanding our opening up to the world will be of great significance for spurring the development of our national economy .
taking the textile industry as an example , after joining the wto , the developed countries will gradually relax their restrictions on china in line with the provisions of the wto textile accord , and all quota controls will be finally abolished in 2005 ; thus our textile industry will gain more export and job opportunities .
continually expanding our opening up to the world , actively taking part in the international multilateral trade setup , and taking the initiative to adapt to the current international rules will help to promote the continual perfection of china 's socialist market economy system and impel the process of our reforms and opening up .
active participation in international competition will help to spur china 's economic restructuring and industrial upgrading , so that we can make better use of foreign funds , technology , and management experience to enhance and improve the management standards and operating situation of china 's enterprises , and boost our all - round economic strength and international competitiveness .
take agriculture as an example .
a few days ago , nato decided to replace landcent ( the allied forces ' command in central europe ) with the eurocorps , a non - nato staff department , as the head of the peacekeeping force in kosovo (kfor) .
this spectacular initiative by nato not only signifies the first independent move by eurocorps but also marks the acceleration of the pace in the creation of an independent security setup by eu .
arguably , it is truly not easy for eu to get what some have jokingly called " lieutenant 's command " from the mammoth military apparatus of nato .
during their summit held at the end of 1998 , french and british leaders published a " declaration on european defense , " asserting that eu should rely on a reliable military force and acquire the ability for independent military action . "
in 1992 , the armed forces of germany , france , and three other european countries set up the eurocorps without the participation of americans . the eurocorps is under the western european union and has nothing to do with nato .
at the end of last year , eu also decided to establish a 50,000 - men to 60,000 - men rapid reaction force by 2003 as europe 's own security safeguard organization capable of taking action within 60 days of the outbreak of a crisis .
next month , eu will set up a " political and security council " to formulate policies and strategies for its crisis management apparatus , the rapid reaction force .
even though the united states does not oppose the development of " europe 's unique defense " in words , deep in its heart it has felt uneasy about the tendency toward europe 's independence in defense matters , fearful that if the tendency continues , us dominance in europe 's defense matters will be difficult to sustain .
in the past , european countries have always depended on the united states for their military and security safeguards . the outbreak of a number of crises hitting the european continent in recent years has made it realize the crisis facing it .
especially during europe 's internal crises , such as the bosnia - herzegovina and kosovo crises , eu felt helpless and found it difficult to deal with the crisis on their own .
precisely because of this helplessness , eu has accelerated the pace to establish an independent defense setup , a defense setup that is not " purely an idea but possesses the ability to enforce . "
starting from today , we will run a series of reports by this correspondent on " moving toward a new millennium , " briefing readers on the future expectations of various countries , their strategic thoughts on development , and how they seize opportunities to cope with challenges .
in early spring , china 's northern neighbor , russia , is moving toward a new millennium with new hopes .
for the past few years , russia 's economic indicators have reached the highest level .
in the first 10 months of last year , direct foreign investment in russia hit $ 3.1 billion , 1.6 times more than the corresponding period the preceding year . this is the result of the improvement in the investment environment .
the new russian state duma was elected at the end of last year .
people notice that on the issue of chechnya , the russian government not only has enjoyed support from various political forces but also has brought about the unity of the whole nation . this is a political phenomenon rarely seen for many years in russia .
at the first government work conference this year , putin proposed three major tasks for 2000 : first , formulating strategies and plans for national economic development . second , maintaining the present favorable economic momentum . third , consolidating and improving the state power mechanism .
before that , putin told some scientists and university students at russia 's first science festival , that : " science and technology and education are a driving force for resolving russian issues . without being competitive in science and technology , the country will have no future . "
the russian government has a better understanding of the situation and the tasks facing it .
for the past decade , russia has seen a lower economic efficiency , a decrease in investment in science and technology , and a lack of enthusiasm for production investment , thus significantly undermining the social productive forces .
with the arrival of the new millennium , russia lost a free secondary school education system and a public health services system , for which it strove for many years .
the gap between rich and poor and the growing number of the poor are social phenomena in russia .
while russia 's crime rate is going up , its living standard is declining .
hence , russia first should step up efforts to develop " locomotive " products - - scientific and technological products - - and sharpen its competitive edge in the international market in order to spur overall economic growth .
at the turn of the century , a new and dynamic atmosphere indeed prevailed in russia , and the people pinned their hopes on russia 's future .
political observers , however , clear - headedly indicated that russia is a state full of variables , and that no one dare guarantee that there will be no further major political changes in the run - up to the presidential election , which is 40 - odd days away .
these factors are temporary . a country 's positive economic operation depends primarily on the increase in both investment and aggregate demand .
there is no optimism about these two major economic indicators for russia .
it was also disclosed at the briefings that beijing cracked 21,285 criminal cases , more than half of which were major cases .
over 21,000 suspects were arrested and 2,000 - plus criminal gangs were wiped out .
it was said at the briefings that beijing cracked 526 cases of drug - trafficking , arrested more than 700 drug - traffickers , and seized 138,000 grams of narcotics .
it was also said that beijing carried out raids on over 6,200 venues operating without a license or beyond their licensed scope , as well as venues where prostitution and other services of paid companionship were offered , and closed down more than 4,000 of these according to law .
armey expressed the hope that congress would vote before the end of july .
the lawmakers also distributed a report of findings by the us congressional research service on the agreement on china 's accession to the wto .
the report states : china is currently one of the world 's fastest - developing economies , and it is expected to become the world 's largest market for consumer goods and services .
china 's accession to the wto will provide the united states with an opportunity for massive exports to and investments in china .
citing projections by us secretary of agriculture dan glickman , the report states that implementation of the us - china agreement on china 's accession to the wto may increase us exports of agricultural products to china by $ 2 billion each year .
china and the united states signed an agreement on china 's accession to the wto in beijing last november . the agreement will take effect only after it is approved by the us congress .
from 1994 to 1999 , annual direct import from taiwan rose from $ 1.68 billion to $ 7.02 billion , up by 33.1 percent on an average , and annual export to taiwan from $ 530 million to $ 2.4 billion , up by 35.3 percent on an average .
at the same time , they transferred armed police corps commanders and put into effect a system of rotational transfers .
besides strengthening their missile defense and attack capabilities , the chinese communists recently went further to deploy the israeli phalcon radar on russian - made illusion-76 transport aircraft , thus possessing a preliminary airborne early warning capability .
on china 's unification and taiwan independence , 57.5 percent of those polled favored maintaining the status quo , and those favoring taiwan independence and unification between the two sides of the strait accounted for 13.9 percent and 10.4 percent respectively .
tang yao - ming yesterday held a spring festival dinner party with military reporters from domestic and foreign media .
therefore , the remaining 32 percent of voters who had not made up their minds have become the key to deciding the results of the election .
results of the poll showed that the support rating of the ch ' en - lu ticket , which dropped to 21 percent at the end of january due to the stock exchange taxation issue , gained 3 percentage points to reach 24 percent .
as to other presidential candidates , the hsu hsin - liang - chu huei - liang ticket gained 1 percent , and the other ticket did not show any gains .
further inquiry about the candidates they will likely support showed that those who had not made up their minds would add 2 percentage points to each of the ch ' en - lu and soong - chang tickets and would likely give the lien - hsiao ticket another 3 percentage points .
although the strength of the three tickets was about the same , on favoritism rating , the lien - hsiao ticket stood out .
the poll showed that 39 percent of voters thought that with the kmt 's huge resources and organizational and mobilization capacity , the lien - hsiao ticket , although its support rating has not risen , eventually will emerge .
changes in voter support for lien chan were also minimal , with 51 percent of respondents supporting him and 34 percent not supporting him .
the poll also discovered that voter confidence in the ability of lien , pien and sung in leading the state was the highest for lien chan , with 63 percent of respondents saying that they were confident in putting the state in his hands , and 20 percent saying that they had no confidence in him .
confidence in sung ch ' u - yu was similar to that shown in the previous poll , with 43 percent of respondents saying that they were confident in his ability to handle state affairs , and 39 percent saying that they had no confidence .
in early january , 42 percent of respondents said that they were confident in putting the country in his hands , and 39 percent said that they did not . in the recent poll , however , 39 percent say that they had confidence , but 43 percent say they had no confidence .
hackers are practically everywhere on the net ; government and military core secrets , enterprises ' commercial secrets , and personal secrets are all among the things they peep at .
it is of an intellectual nature .
it is greatly detrimental to society .
a host of facts have proved that the greater the dependence of society on network systems , the higher the incidence of computer crime becomes .
when designing their networks , many large foreign websites had attached great importance to their security .
as china 's major organizations are now becoming increasingly dependent on networks , there will be extremely grave consequences should hackers succeed in their assaults .
our country should develop its own anti - hacking technology and must not rely on imports . " if a lock is bought from others , it can be unlocked by others . "
even in the virtual space of networks , people still hope to have an unpolluted , blue sky .
beijing , 16 feb ( xinhua ) - - china 's railroads must stand at the level of the overall situation and strategy of modernization , actively implement the cpc central committee 's great policy decision on major development of west china , and lose no time in going ahead of the rest in promoting this development .
minister of railroads fu zhihuan talked freely about the thinking on railroad development in west china when interviewed by this reporter .
in their policy decision on major development of west china , the cpc central committee and state council have decided to concentrate forces to tackle the important work related to the overall situation of developing west china , and speeding up infrastructure construction is in the primary position .
at present there are 14,858 km of railroad in west china ; there is a shortage of capacity , there are few lines , and they are of low standard ; there are not many lines from west to central china , and inadequate routes between the western provinces and autonomous regions .
it is estimated that investment in large and medium - sized railroad construction projects in west china during the 10 th five - year plan will reach about 100 billion yuan , and that there will be about 18,000 km of railroad in the region by 2005 .
we should improve communications between the western provinces and autonomous regions .
we should step up the building of international communications .
we should intensify improvement of the existing lines .
the focus will be on completing the capacity expansion of the xining - germu section of the qinghai - tibet line , electrification of the chengdu - kunming line , and the capacity expansion of forming west china railroad electrification into a network , section by section .
fu zhihuan said that while speeding up railroad construction in west china , we should further implement the strategy for increasing speeds .
the passenger train chart for national day this year should embody the initial results in this respect .
for instance , passenger train travel time from beijing to urumqi will be reduced from 60 hours now to 48 hours .
jiang zemin , general secretary of the cpc central committee and state president , wrote the title of the handbook and also made important comments urging the leading cadres at various levels to conscientiously study taxation knowledge and to pay high attention to and actively support the tax collection work .
in shanghai 's renminbi trading market , the exchange rate of renminbi closed by a slight increase today , which , according to a dealer , was affected by the reduced demand for us dollars .
the closing quotation of the us dollar against renminbi was $ 1 to 8.2776 yuan , a slight fall from tuesday 's closing rate of 8.2777 yuan .
as china has fixed its economic goals at opening to the outside world in a comprehensive way , absorbing more foreign capital , and intensifying domestic competitive power , the pressure of renminbi depreciation will not exist in the coming few years , instead , there is room and demand for its appreciation .
he stressed that after entering the wto , china will have a sound equilibrium of international payments , and the exchange rate of renminbi will continue to remain stable .
it is anticipated that the export and investment this year will somewhat increase , and foreign investment will continue to grow as well after china 's accession to the wto .
in terms of exchange rate policy , china still adopts a floating rate system under which exchange rates are controlled and determined by market supply and demand .
thanks to the equilibrium of the international payments , china 's exchange rates have all along been comparatively stable .
a financial expert pointed out that , on the whole , there are three major factors that will make renminbi exchange rate continue to remain firm in the future .
first , the special characteristics and nature of china 's economic growth have conditioned the value and trend of renminbi .
china 's economic strength , particularly the foreign economic balancing ability , has been substantially enhanced in the 20 years of development , so that china is capable of accepting such a challenge as opening its financial sector to the outside world , and is powerful enough to maintain a stable currency value .
china possesses an exchange reserve amounting to over $ 150 billion and , at the same time , after nearly two years of stagnation , the export exhibits a momentum of vigorous growth .
china 's financial and monetary authorities expect that the implementation of the multi - currency policy and measures in 2000 will also contribute to the stability and appreciation of renminbi 's value .
in the meantime , a relative shortage of domestic resources will arise , making renminbi even more " valuable . "
besides successfully completing the mission of carrying out institutional reform aimed at combining the " three types of inspections , " they achieved fairly good results in performing their duty of enforcing inspection and quarantine laws .
in addition , they actively served the export sector and took the initiative in mapping out measures to reduce fees and improve services .
wu yi stressed : faced with the new situation in which china will join the world trade organization , we should expand the role of inspection and quarantine departments .
we should earnestly improve management , rationalize internal relations , and improve efficiency in law enforcement .
wu yi stressed : we should raise our awareness of service and provide good service to the foreign trade sector .
inspection and quarantine departments should draw on their advantages in technology , information , and service to serve enterprises and help them improve product quality , raise their technological standards , and expand exports .
in particular , inspection and quarantine departments play an irreplaceable role in expanding china 's exports of agricultural products .
in trying to expand the utilization of foreign capital , we also need the coordination of inspection and quarantine departments to create an investment climate that is favorable to improving the quality and standard of utilizing foreign capital .
the spirit of the plenary session of the central discipline inspection commission should be seriously carried out and attention should practically be paid to the work of leading officials honesty and self - discipline within the financial sector .
finance is the core of modern economy , he pointed out .
wen jiabao pointed out , in accordance with the actual condition of the financial departments , leading officials must pass " five barriers " which includes barrier of politics , power , money , pleasure - seeking , and relatives and friends before they can really act incorruptible and self - disciplined .
passing the politics barrier requires bearing in mind the purpose of the party , insisting on the basic line , abiding by the discipline , maintaining the true qualities of the working class vanguard , and serving the people wholeheartedly , wen jiabao said .
passing the power barrier means to correctly treat and use power , reasonably use power for the people , manage well the money , stop abusing power for personal gain and trading power for money , wen jiabao pointed out .
the financial sector is in charge of management , use and inspection of credit , bond and insurance fund . under the condition of the market economy , power of controlling financial resource is of vital importance .
the more power we control , the heavier our responsibility is .
we must have the public spirit and insist on principle .
we should by no means be able to take advantage of granting loans to ask for or take bribes and take advantage of stock - issuing and insurance settlement to make power - for - money deals .
passing the money barrier requires remaining uncorrupt , absolutely honest , incorruptible , and completely not getting involved in corruption .
our financial officials who manage money for the country and the people should be able to remain uncorrupted .
they should do their jobs conscientiously and be faithful in the discharge of their duties to let the party and the people rest assured .
passing the pleasure - seeking barrier needs to bear hardships before enjoying comforts , needs to be diligent and honest in work , and needs to work hard , wen jiabao said .
we are communists who should " be concerned before anyone else and enjoy oneself only after everyone else finds enjoyment , " should emulate work contribution and achievement not enjoyment in life .
we should start with the leading cadres to set up good examples for cadres at lower levels .
leading cadres should keep a cool head on this issue and must strictly discipline their relatives and children .
leading cadres should also discipline well their staff members .
leading cadres not only should be honest and self - disciplined but also should seriously carry out the responsibility system of improving the work style and building a clean and honest government , wen jiabao stressed .
leading cadres should insist on principles , should have the courage to manage or challenge a powerful opponent .
leading cadres at all levels should put themselves under the management and supervision of the party organization .
they should further rigorously enforce inner - party living regulations and list investigation of leading cadres honesty and self - discipline as an important content of meeting of democracy practice .
major issues must be collectively discussed and determined by the party committee in order to avoid personal arbitrary decision .
we should accept the social and press supervision .

this is an effective way to deepen rectification and reform and to consolidate and enlarge the fruits of education and ensure that the " three stresses " education is not done in a superficial way .
facts have fully shown that the significance of the concentrated " three stresses " education is far - reaching and notable results have been achieved .
we should realize , however , that we cannot overestimate the success achieved ; some of the problems brought to light during the concentrated education have not yet been resolved well , and the task of implementing and completing the rectification and reform scheme remains very arduous .
it should be said that the concentrated education is the " top sheet " of the entire composition , and the thorough rectification and reform after the concentrated education is the " last sheet . "
if the concentrated education was done quite well , but the thorough rectification and reform work has not matched it , the results of the entire " three stresses " education will be greatly devalued .
the party committees at all levels must fully understand the importance and necessity of " looking back , " and make ever greater efforts to grasp " looking back " in the same way that they grasped the concentrated education , so as to thoroughly implement the central authorities ' plan .
in " looking back " it is first necessary to deepen study .
the " three stresses " education is self - education in marxism for leading cadres .
" looking back " is a process of study , enhancement , and unification of thinking , and a process of recalling and summing up , squarely facing the deficiencies , and making continuous progress .
all areas and departments must study in depth the important instructions of the cpc central committee and the important speeches of comrade jiang zemin in close connection with the reality of their areas and departments , and raise to a new level the work of summing up the past and planning for the future .
generally speaking , closely centering on stressing politics - - the core - - we should focus on enhancing ideological understanding and resolving the existing problems .
as regards the existing problems , we must analyze the causes in a truth - seeking way , unfold serious and conscientious criticism and self - criticism , and reach the goal of exchanging thinking , helping and enhancing each other , and promoting work .
we must make full use of the successful experiences of the concentrated education , carry forward the party 's work style of linking with reality , keeping in close touch with the masses , and practicing criticism and self - criticism , and be sure to pursue practical results .
an industry source said that operation of the nuclear power plant marks the end of the period in which china was not able to produce key equipment for nuclear power plants .
the successful development and manufacturing of the main ducts has filled the gap in china 's manufacture of nuclear power equipment . it also has an important impact on the development of china 's nuclear power industry in the new century .
nuclear power is one of the universally recognized safe , clean , and highly efficient energy sources .
taking advantage of its aod furnace smelting technology and its 20 - year old centrifugal pouring technology , it began to set foot in the manufacture of nuclear power equipment in 1996 .
his deeds have reflected the mental outlook of the party 's theoretical workers in the new period and provided profound enlightenment and beneficial lessons for conducting ideological and political work in various military units .
at present , reforms of state and military affairs are intensifying and new situations and problems are emerging constantly . therefore we are faced with many heavy tasks .
party committees and political departments at various levels must pay great attention to the study of theory and adopt effective measures to grasp this work in a solid manner .
yu yongbo said : the source of consciousness in studying theory is a firm belief in our ideals .
yuan shoufang , deputy director of the general political department , presided over the report meeting .
tang tianbiao and zhang shutian , deputy directors of the general political department as well as more than 300 cadres at divisional or higher level of the organ of the general political department and units directly under the department attended the report meeting .
xiamen caught the attention of the outside world last year when it was in a " complicated and difficult " situation .
hong yongshi confessed that the city had not done enough in building a clean government and had not been strict enough politically . due to laxness in education , management , and supervision of leading cadres , some profound problems had not been discovered in time and some leading cadres and personnel were involved in smuggling and corruption .
he said : the city has given positive support and assistance to the central special investigation team in the thorough investigation of major smuggling cases . it must make profound introspections in its future investigation and handling of smuggling cases , and draw lessons and inferences from mistakes in order to be stricter in running the government .
hong yongshi said : this year we will conscientiously implement the five - year plan , and promote the drive to govern the city by law . efforts will be made to formulate rules for administrative law enforcement , and make the government more transparent by implementing the system of openness in administrative law enforcement .
new york , 15 feb (zxs) - - zhang hongxi , china 's consul general in new york , said the taiwan issue is what all the chinese people are most concerned about .
zhang hongxi made these remarks when he spoke of chinese ambassador li zhaoxing 's reply letter to us senator jesse helms at a spring festival reception he hosted for overseas chinese media in new york .
zhang hongxi said : we have hoped for many years to use the formula of " one country , two systems " to peacefully resolve the taiwan issue .
now , some people , however , are trying to instigate chinese to fight chinese and compel us step by step to use force .
they turn a blind eye to things that are very obvious , and refuse to comprehend what is transparent to even ordinary people .
they talk about human rights everyday as if the 1.3 billion chinese people do not have a voice . they treat a few criminals as guests of honor and talk at length about what they call " human rights . " should we not give these people a lecture ?
he said : some of these people have never been to china and are totally ignorant about tibet . yet , they still stand there making criticism . their standards are truly low , although it goes without saying that the cultural gaps between the east and west are too big .
since the report on sentencing hu changqing to death was broadcast by the central television station in its news program yesterday evening , it has become the topic of conversation among people in various localities of the province .
in his speech at the forum , vice education minister lu fuyuan said : these incidents seemed to be accidental criminal cases but judged from deeper perspectives , they are the reflection of problems in various fields , such as school education , social education , and home education .

at the evening party , many old friends met again and some made new friends . the participants drank tea and talked with each other , exchanging sentiments of friendship .
china has decided to speed up internet development .
li pointed out : " after reviewing the relevant transcripts and notes , i have come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong or inappropriate about minister liu 's remarks at the news conference .
the message he wanted to convey was that if the security enhancement act bill were made into law , the consequences would be even more serious .
the nearest comparison i can think of is that , as an american academic put it , even primary school pupils know that taiwan is part of china , but many political figures do not seem to know this truth . "
in fact , a few us congressmen have made some irresponsible remarks about the internal affairs of other countries , but it often happens they do not have even the basic knowledge .
this has aroused the indignation of the chinese people . the chinese diplomat just told the truth and yet helms and his ilk have flown into a rage . this shows that these congressmen are rude and unreasonable and are lacking in upbringing .
instead of becoming hysterical , it would be better for senator helms to calm down , comprehensively and objectively ponder sino - us relations , and have a better understanding of china 's present conditions .
on 11 february the headquarters for the first time directed the " routine military exercise " of using submarines to block the taiwan strait in the name of " welcoming the vessel . "

the reserve forces at all localities also have started to clean air - raid shelters and examine air - raid facilities .
some of the transport ships and vehicles have been assembled . these ships and vehicles will be used to deliver troops to take part in the " routine military exercises . "
claiming to be denied entry by the hong kong government chen shui - bian also hoped that hong kong would be able to play a more frequent and positive role in cross - strait affairs .
he hoped that the hong kong media present at the interview would make more appeals on this matter .
deciding taiwan 's future by referendum however , chen shui - bian still stressed that taiwan was a sovereign state independent of the prc . he said that this was a fact as well as a reality , and that changing the country 's name was out of the question ( because taiwan is already a country ) .
alleging that lien chan had sent an envoy to beijing chen shui - bian demanded that lien chan clarify this matter to the public , but there was no response from lien chan yesterday .
he also alleged that lien chan had asked a senior kmt adviser to speak to lee teng - hui , asking the latter to give up the post of party chairman .
in particular , the 15 th national party congress , out of a strategic consideration of party building , state apparatus building and the maintenance of a lasting peace and order , gave a profound explanation and put forward even more clear and definite demands for preventing and correcting corruption at the revenue source .
the party committees , the governments and the fee and fine collecting departments at various levels have seriously carried out the spirit of the 15 th national party committee and the unified plan of the party central committee and the state council and have achieved noticeable success in practicing " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
this year , all the fee and fine collecting departments will comprehensively and thoroughly practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
the judicial organ and the administrative law - enforcement organ shoulder the heavy responsibility of implementing laws and regulations and their basic code of conduct and mandatory requirement are to manage government affairs in accordance with the law and enforce the law impartially .
so , to practice " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management is an effective measure to prevent corruption at the revenue source ; and it will play an important role in improving the work style of government organs , cultivating a good party style and government discipline and keep state functionaries honest and industrious .
we should see that there still exist some problems in the practice of " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing the revenues of collected administrative service fees , fines and forfeitures .
to solve the aforesaid problems , we should , on the one hand , continue to step up propaganda and education and further strengthen supervision and management , while on the other hand , we should formulate and strictly enforce discipline .
once the work criteria and requirements are clarified , the discipline should keep pace with them . to back an order with law is an important guarantee for practicing " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management .
to promote comprehensive implementation of the " separation between revenue and expenditure " provisions , it is necessary to enforce discipline , use the discipline as a guarantee , resolutely investigate violators and apply strict disciplinary sanctions against them .
the supervisory , auditing , fiscal , commodity price and banking departments at all levels should improve coordination among themselves , do a good job in supervision and inspection , resolutely investigate and deal with any violations of the stipulations on " separation between revenue and expenditure " in revenue management , and never tolerate such violations .
the guangdong ling ao nuclear power station built by the sichuan chemical engineering machinery plant passed a readiness review by the proprietor and shipment was formally started on 16 february .
nuclear power has become one of the safe , clean and highly efficient energy sources universally accepted in the world , and many countries have considered it a key development project .
at present , only the daya bay nuclear power plant and the qinshan nuclear power plant have been built and put into operation .
a concerned person is convinced that importing nuclear power equipment from abroad is too costly and building nuclear power equipment at home will be an important factor in developing nuclear power in china .

the consulate general of the democratic people 's republic of korea [ dprk ] in hong kong was opened officially yesterday .
the office will process business visas and provide information on the dprk to the outside world .
this is the first time the dprk has set up a diplomatic organization in hong kong .

in no way can such an industry be abandoned .
the united states is a " country on wheels , " whose economic development is inextricably linked with automobiles .
during the 15 years of japan 's fast economic development , the national economy of that country scored a 36 - fold growth , while the output value of its automobile industry increased 57 times .
in contrast , the british economic status has declined with the dwindling of its automobile industry .
sales records of beijing 's major automobile markets show that last year sales of private vehicles accounted for 90 percent of the total sales volume .
but if we develop it with new ideas and by using new technologies , i think we can open a new way .
in the past , the invention of automobiles certainly brought an earth - shaking change to the world .
the reason for pessimism among some people at present is that they have no confidence in our own technologies .
for instance , some of our science and technology experts once visited our big automobile plants and offered to help develop robots for doing the spot - welding and spray - painting work , but the plant managers said that they would not use china - made robots .
under the new opening condition , of course , we need to acquire technologies from others , but what is more needed is technologies created by ourselves and intellectual property rights that we can use on our own .
without developing our own technologies , we will have no way out .
if we rely solely on imported technologies , we will definitely be lagging behind others . can any foreign company give its key technologies to a competitor ?
we chinese scientists and technicians should launch a struggle : we should get china 's automobile industry involved in international competition .
the other is that we have advantages in certain fields .
now , the question of the world is how the world should change automobiles . when it comes to china , the question is how china should change its automobiles .
in addition to the above , we have to solve the question of safety .
to solve the above - mentioned questions , we should understand the different demands and study china 's automobile market .
take air - pollution control in beijing as an example .
although automobile manufactures are concerned about money - - they want to do everything possible to save money - - if the state has a law in this respect , the technology for clean exhaust gas will be developed and popularized .
all in all , there is ample room for development . what is needed is the market 's driving force and the related state policies . but the most fundamental determinant is whether we have the consciousness and resolution in this respect and whether we can concentrate our efforts on overcoming the difficulties involved .
china 's automobile industry as a whole is still at a relatively low level , and because of this , it has less problems hindering its development in the new direction .
to develop high technologies , we should aim high and have a firm footing .
beijing , 17 february ( xinhua ) - - the supreme people 's procuratorate today publicized the opinions on a three - year procuratorial reform , which aims to boost the procuratorial reform , improve the procuratorial work , perfect the procuratorial system , and strengthen the procuratorial function .

we should adapt ourselves to the development needs of the times , and to changes in the pattern of war ; and conscientiously reinforce our awareness of overall interests , awareness of system , awareness of quality , awareness of information , and awareness of efficiency .
meanwhile , we must step up our work in every aspect of the logistics support of our army , so as to lay a sound material foundation for combined operations .

does china have any comment on the resignation one after the other of the two iraqi - based representatives of international organizations to protest un sanctions against iraq ?
a : china expresses its concern over the resignation of the two high - level iraqi - based officials of international organizations .
we urge relevant member states to adopt a constructive and responsible attitude to create conditions for improving the humanitarian situation in iraq .
hong kong , 17 feb (zts) - - incidents of hackers doing harm to networks in various parts of various countries have attracted great attention in beijing . a spokesman of the chinese foreign ministry explicitly said not long ago that china is much concerned about hacker incidents and any undesirable behavior on networks is not welcome .
although china 's internet made a late start , it has developed rapidly . it is estimated that at the end of this year , the number of internet users will reach 16 million and e - commerce will become a hot spot .
what shocked the computer specialists was that the network hackers were able to organize a large - scale attack on the networks so easily .
for example , on 27 january , hackers invaded into the international travel service vacation website , at which china 's first online tourist auction had just been conducted .
the computer center of the travel service discovered its secret codes were deciphered by someone with software used by telecommunications departments especially for deciphering secret codes of telephone users , and the hacker entered its chat room in the name of " wang guan , " and deleted all data of online friends registered with the chat room .
initial investigation showed that he is a student of the computer mathematics faculty of the postgraduate school of a well - known university . he has invaded , one after the other , a certain science and technology network and a certain information network in shanghai , causing economic losses of about 100 million yuan .
in recent years , while speeding up the development of the internet , relevant departments in china have energetically adopted effective legal and technological measures to earnestly safeguard the security of networks and to clamp down on network hackers .
he demanded that the us side respect china 's principled stand on this issue and stop interfering in china 's internal affairs .
the chinese government 's crackdown on the organization in accordance with the law is aimed at protecting the basic human rights and freedoms of its citizens ; it is also an effective measure to safeguard social stability and to prevent the organization from doing more harm to the public .
the spokesman said : the us immigration and naturalization service officials disregarded these basic facts and brazenly stated that the united states might grant asylum to " falungong " members from china . this is a typical example of the double standard adopted by the us side on the issue of cults . china expresses firm opposition to this .
at a foreign ministry news briefing here , zhu bangzao commended their laudable and active efforts in improving the humanitarian situation in iraq during their terms in office .
he said china hopes that the secretary general will name suitable personnel to replace them as soon as possible .
the spokesman said : the chinese side has always maintained that the un " oil - for - food " program should be earnestly and comprehensively implemented , so as to ease the humanitarian difficulties facing the iraqi people .
zhu bangzao said : china urges relevant member states to adopt a constructive and responsible attitude and create conditions for the improvement of the humanitarian situation in iraq .
beijing , 17 feb (zxs) - - speaking here today , foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao urged the taiwan authorities to hold negotiations with the mainland to end the state of hostility at an early date .
zhu bangzao once again enunciated the chinese government 's basic principles and positions on the taiwan issue : taiwan is part of chinese territory ; this status cannot be changed .
he said : at a recent ceremony held by people from all circles in beijing to ceremoniously mark the fifth anniversary of president jiang 's important speech , vice premier qian qichen once again clearly reiterated these principles and expounded them anew .
zhu bangzao pointed out emphatically : china has always maintained that the state of hostility across the taiwan strait should be formally brought to an end through negotiations and under the " one china " principle .
the chinese mainland has repeatedly urged the two sides of the taiwan strait to hold dialogue and negotiations on any issue on the basis of the " one china " principle when conditions are ripe .
having fully grasped the situation , zhu bangzao answered , at today 's news briefing held by the foreign ministry , relevant questions put forward by reporters prior to this .
at present , china has started implementing the " agreement . "
in december last year , china 's animal and plant quarantine departments already sent a pre - inspection group to california , florida , and other parts of the united states to pre - inspect oranges in the united states .

he then said that in the past year , governments at various levels have given top priority to the building of a clean and honest administration and the struggle against corruption .
zhu rongji stressed : the central authorities ' fundamental policies for reform and development this year have been clearly set , and concrete arrangements have also been made for the government 's work and tasks .
this is a year at the turn of the century , and it is of great significance for us to carry out our various tasks in reform and development .
clean and honest government depends , above all , on self - discipline .
they should not only strengthen their self - cultivation and be strictly self - disciplined but also do a good job in controling their family members and relatives as well as those working at their sides .
all major cases must be thoroughly investigated no matter which departments or persons are involved .
those involved must be unmasked and severely dealt with one by one , and we must not practice favoritism or be soft on them .
third , we should continue to make vigorous efforts to rectify unhealthy tendencies in trades and departments and conscientiously solve outstanding problems about which the masses are concerned with and are strongly object to .
we should resolutely stop various activities to compare with one another in reaching certain standards .
we should vigorously rectify unhealthy tendencies in the buying and selling of medicines , ensure that the medicines taken by the masses are safe and efficacious , and reduce the irrational burdens on the state and the masses .
we should continue to solve the problem of arbitrarily collecting fees by primary and middle schools and other educational institutions in order to lighten the burden on the masses .
fourth , it is necessary to be diligent , practice strict economy , and combat waste .
this year , we should step up our efforts to investigate and deal with cases in this regard ; we should seize on typical cases , deal with them severely , and make them known to the public .
we should continue the reform of government institutions and further change government functions .
we should establish an administrative system and working mechanism marked by high efficiency , coordinated operations , and standard behavior .
they should conscientiously enforce the " regulations on the system of responsibility for improving the party 's work style and building a clean and honest government " formulated by the party central committee and the state council and strictly implement the system of investigating those who are responsible for failure in building a clean and honest administration .
the supervision and auditing departments should adhere to principles , have the courage to crack the hard cases , are not afraid of offending people , and continue to improve their work .
responsible officials of the ministry of supervision , the ministry of finance , the ministry of construction , the state pharmaceutical supervision and administration , the general administration of customs , and the state economic and trade commission separately spoke at the meeting .
responsible officials of the central discipline inspection commission , the supreme people 's court , and the supreme people 's procuratorate , as well as of the central committees of various democratic parties and the all - china association of industry and commerce , attended the meeting on invitation .
beijing , 17 feb ( xinhua news agency ) - - " mao zedong , deng xiaoping , jiang zemin on ideological and political work , " a book compiled by the propaganda department of the cpc central committee , has now been officially published for distribution .
comrade jiang zemin 's expositions on ideological and political work represent a continuation , enrichment , and development of the theories on ideological and political work created by the party 's first and second - generation leadership nuclei .
they are crystallizations of the wisdom of the entire party , are valuable ideological assets , and are powerful theoretical weapons and important guidelines with which we can strengthen and improve ideological work at present .
this is our honorable mission and sacred duty .
the party 's leadership nuclei across three generations gave very brilliant expositions on the status and function of ideological and political work .
they conclude , in a nutshell , that maintaining ideological education is a central link in the process of uniting the whole party in a great struggle ; ideological and political work is a lifeline for economic work and all other work .
judging by the practice in reform , opening up , and socialist modernization in china , the deeper the reform goes , the broader the opening up becomes , and the more developed the socialist market economy is , the more important it is to set great store by the work in this respect .
our comrades across the whole party must be soberly aware that in the context of opening up and developing the market economy , the struggle in the ideological and political domain will not only continue to exist for a long time to come , but is also very complicated and sometimes may even become intense .
studying and publicizing the expositions made by the three generations of leadership nuclei of our party on ideological and political work requires us to study new circumstances , solve new problems , and actively explore the laws and methods regarding ideological and political work under the new circumstances .
this is an important idea that all three generations of leadership nuclei of the party have had regarding ideological and political work and also an important and urgent project facing our comrades across the whole party . we must make strenuous efforts to solve well this issue .
studying and publicizing the expositions made by the three generations of leadership nuclei of our party on ideological and political work should be combined with implementing the cpc central committee 's " a number of opinions on strengthening and improving ideological and political work , " striving toward comprehensively accomplishing all the tasks of reform and construction this year .
the tasks are very arduous . to unify thinking , bring people 's hearts and minds together , boost the morale , and arouse the enthusiasm and creativity of the people depends on our work , especially ideological and political work .
conscientious efforts should be made to strengthen the party 's leadership over ideological and political work , work closely around economic construction as the central task , and implement the guidelines , principles , objectives , and requirements of ideological and political work at the grassroots levels and the mass level .

zhu bangzhao stressed that taiwan is part of china 's territory and that this cannot be changed .
our basic principle on persisting in peaceful reunification and " one country , two systems " for solving the taiwan issue has remained unchanged .
it is generally believed that economic issues will be put at the top of the agenda for the third plenary session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] next month .
after institutional reform in 1998 , state council ministries and commissions , notably the setc , have attracted much attention .
when zhu rongji unveiled his cabinet , sheng huaren , then president of the china petrochemical corporation , was unexpectedly named setc minister .
sheng huaren advanced in years ; his achievements mediocre a source familiar with sheng huaren said that a diligent and conscientious official , sheng has a reputation of being an " old ox " of the setc .
sheng huaren , 65 , has reached retirement age at the ministerial level , and his achievements for the past two years have been mediocre . it is said that the top chinese leadership is not happy with sheng 's work performance and has decided to remove him from office at this year 's npc session .
sources revealed that sdpc vice minister li rongrong will replace sheng huaren after his recent transfer to the position of setc vice minister .
his transfer may well be termed " the resumption of his old profession .
" concerns over vacant positions of npc vice chairmen two vice chairmen positions are vacant after npc vice chairman xie fei died of illness and another vice chairman , cheng kejie , was placed under investigation for bribery .
there are concerns over whether the forthcoming npc session will announce and explain cheng kejie 's case .
li and huang have long been regarded as members of the fourth - generation cpc leadership . their transfer to beijing is just a matter of time , but whether the pair will be transferred at this year 's npc session remains to be seen .
when cable and wireless officially notified hong kong telecom on 24 january that it was negotiating with singapore telecom on merging the latter two , the market was not at all surprised at the merger .
reportedly , beijing did not give them an immediate response .
if uk cable and wireless is willing to sell hong kong telecom , there are several consortia in hong kong that are capable of taking over hong kong telecom . hence , they indirectly voiced their opposition to the merger between singapore telecom and hong kong telecom .
president ben ali asked tang jiaxuan to communicate his cordial regards to president jiang zemin .
ben ali indicated that the relationship between tunisia and china is very good . he expressed gratitude to the chinese government for its assistance to tunisia 's economic construction .
since tunisia is an incumbent nonpermanent member of the un security council , china is willing to strengthen consultations with tunisia and to work together with tunisia to safeguard the rights and benefits of developing countries .
ben ali said that china has a population of 1.2 billion . china has done a good job in resolving food , housing , transportation , and educational problems for the people , thus embodying its endeavors to respect the human rights .
at the invitation of tunisian foreign minister yahia , tang jiaxuan arrived in tunisia on the evening of 16 february to begin his three - day visit to tunisia .
on 17 february , he held talks with yahia on further developing the bilateral ties and the issues of common concern .
tang jiaxuan expressed gratitude to tunisia for its understanding and support of china 's great cause of national reunification and the human rights issue .
tang jiaxuan stressed that the chinese government pays attention to promoting and safeguarding the human rights and basic freedom .
as for the developing countries , the rights to survival and development are the highest human rights .
according to its own special features , tunisia has selected development ways which are suitable to its national situation and has made noticeable achievements in safeguarding social stability , promoting the development of the economy , and improving the living conditions of the people ; thus tunisia has done its best to safeguard human rights .
after the meeting , the foreign ministers of the two countries attended the ceremony to sign the agreement on the sino - tunisian economic and technological cooperation .
like arrows darting away from bowstrings , the missile launching operators , in full battle array , swiftly drew themselves into their combat positions upon the issuance of an order from the commander , " the antitank missile detachment launches an attack ! "
" missile erection is ready !
" fire ! "
one could only see that a missile launcher pressed a red button lightly with his index finger , and immediately , with the sound of a whistle , a " hongjian [ red arrow ] " rose high into the air dragging a fresh red licking flame .
on the field , the astonished crowd burst into thunderous applause at once .
until now , he has launched 16 antitank missiles , with a marvelous shooting average of 100 percent , enough to be compared favorably with the students majoring in antitank missile command .
in the missile company , there are plenty of expert soldiers like li bin who enjoy such good names as " miracle - working doctor of missiles , " " a wonder shooter of missiles , " " artillery expert , " and others .
as stipulated , a soldier needs to master only two of these weapons .
how could such a small detachment achieve so many tops ?
the training method was strongly opposed by experts when first proposed .
with repeated training of more than 1,000 times , the officers and men finally mastered the unique technique .
china is a big developing country whose economy is undergoing the process of changing tracks , and the economic growth in china has a very close relationship with the economic structure and adjustment .
looking back at the track of china 's rapid economic growth over the past 20 years , we can easily find out the fact that economic growth always originates from the structural imbalance , and the realization or disappearance of the growth always depends upon the distorted alleviation or aggravation of the structural contradictions .
therefore , the structure - related policies can be regarded as the core policies of economic growth in china .
after entering the year 2000 , what contradictions have emerged in china 's economic structure ? i should like to take this opportunity to advance my own views on two issues .
first , let me present my views on the first issue .
recently i looked up some research data and found that since 1990 , the proportions of the secondary industry and industry in the gdp as calculated at constant prices have been rising continuously , while that of the service industry has been declining , which is an extremely abnormal phenomenon .
comparing 1998 with 1990 , the proportion of the secondary industry rose from 41.6 percent to 55.6 percent , of which the proportion of industry rose from 37 percent to 51 percent , increasing by a big margin that was seldom seen before .
if we make a comparison of different countries in the world , we will find that the current proportion of china 's service industry is lower by about 10 percentage points than that of the low - income countries .
second , it is owing to the incorrect discrimination and prejudice against the service industry as well as the deep - rooted ideas that " a country cannot be prosperous without industry " and " the development of the service industry cannot deviate from the development of industry . "
the present proposition is to turn the agricultural population into urban population . however , we should not employ the traditional , planned approach of building a number of new cities and transfer the residents there step by step .
the genuine question lies in how we should form a more appealing and energetic urban economic development dynamic mechanism that will sufficiently attract the surplus labor power in the rural areas to move into cities by way of marketization .
very obviously , as a result of this process , a number of cities will come into being .
another example , the civilian - run economy is now gradually playing the guiding role in the economic growth as a whole , but the structure and system still have partiality for the morbid state - owned sectors .
what is more , china 's economy is confronted with the impacts from the global integration and network society , but at present all kinds of rules are seriously unsuitable to this situation .
the fourth structural contradiction is manifested in the fact that the company and enterprise management structural reform are not in place .
there is a very definite relationship between the company 's management structure and growth , because the investors ' confidence will not be strengthened unless there is a sound company management structure .
suggestions on structural adjustment [ subhead ] second , this is about the way of thinking and the orientation of policies for further formulating the structural adjustment policies . taken as a whole , the aforementioned structural adjustment policies are matters relating to further reform .
hence , the structural adjustment in the next step is , in essence , the institutional adjustment .
since time is limited , i think i will lay stress on the following four problems .
third , a major precondition of this adjustment is the division of labor between the government and the markets in terms of functions and roles , and what the government should do must be clearly defined .
fourth , a direct starting point for carrying out the adjustment policies is to continue the reform of the government .
beijing , 18 feb (zxs) - - a steady stream of reports that recently emanated from china 's authoritative organs indicate that the new tax system that china instituted in 1994 faces adjustment as china 's macroeconomic environment changes while it goes through a different stage .
moreover , china instituted land value - added taxes and regulatory taxes on investment in fixed assets , with a view to reining in overheating in investment through tax regulation .
as a deflationary trend has arisen in china , however , jump - starting investment has become a top priority .
this requires relevant adjustments to the tax system .
to this end , relevant authorities have decided to stop collecting regulatory taxes on investment in fixed assets this year .
taxation departments have already taken initial actions in those sectors whose incomes will not suffer greatly as a result of such actions .
relevant personnel said : china 's mid - term goal is to raise the proportion of its tax revenue to its gross domestic product to the average level of developing countries .
as china 's accession to the world trade organization draws near , the pressure of accession has become a driving force for further reforming and improving the tax system .
the new trends of development in the international economy are compelling china to adjust its tax system .
the two most compelling trends are the expansion of multinational operations and the growth of electronic commerce .
relevant personnel agreed that china 's current tax system is incompatible with these new trends and that efforts must be stepped up to study measures for coping with these trends .
although china has adopted some measures in accordance with the demands of the international and domestic economic environments for changes to its tax system , it must proceed prudently with overall tax reform .
in recent years , some students have run away from home and committed suicide as a result of the heavy academic burden from primary and secondary schools . from time to time , fatal incidents have occurred in which students were maimed or killed after their parents had put pressure on them and teachers inflicted physical punishment on them .
on 17 january this year , a student at zhejiang jinhua city no. 4 high school beat his mother to death because of his academic results and parental pressure .
although this is an extreme case in a tiny minority , it is sufficient to show : reducing the heavy academic burden on students and fostering their fine psychological quality and legal concepts are a pressing task .
since the prc 's founding , the party and government have all along attached great importance to the healthy growth of primary and secondary school students and have time and again checked the bad practice of increasing the burden on students .
the three generations of the party leadership cores , mao zedong , deng xiaoping , and jiang zemin , have issued important instructions on this aspect .
to implement the spirit of central leaders ' instructions on easing students ' heavy burden , the state department of education administration released a number of documents , adopted a series of measures , and repeatedly formulated special plans to reduce the heavy burden on primary and secondary school students .
hence , " the heavy burden on students " is not only an education problem but also a social issue .
these examples of effectively reducing students ' burden and helping them establish a correct outlook on the world and life and values have boosted our confidence in overcoming the chronic problem of " burden reduction . "
reducing students ' academic , economic , and psychological burden is not only a pressing task at present but also a long - term strategic mission .
we should educate cadres , headmasters , teachers , and parents to establish correct outlooks on education , quality , and talent so that the comprehensive implementation of quality education and the enhancement of education quality will become a society - wide consensus .
we should speed up the reform of the course system , structure , and content of primary and secondary schools and set up a new curriculum system compatible with social development .
it is also necessary to further reform the entrance examination system and promptly establish entrance examination and education appraisal systems that meet the requirements of quality education .
as a matter of fact , there is no positive connection between " burden reduction " and lowered teaching quality . instead , the purpose of " burden reduction " is to raise education quality .
therefore , parents should acquire a correct outlook on education quality , support school measures for " burden reduction , " and help schools genuinely ease the heavy burden on children .
doing a good job in easing students ' heavy burden has a direct bearing on the comprehensive promotion of quality education , on the healthy growth of the younger generation , and on the position of the chinese nation in international competition in the 21 st century .
shi guangsheng briefed moore on the progress in negotiations on china 's accession to the wto .
shi guangsheng said : after joining the wto , china , as a large country that acts responsibly , will fulfill its obligations , observe wto rules , and implement bilateral and multilateral agreements while enjoying relevant rights as a wto member .
he said : accession to the wto will bring both opportunities and challenges to china .
he said that china 's accession to the wto would benefit china , other countries in the world , and the wto itself .
he said that his goal is clear , and he hoped china would become a wto member at an early date , so that the wto would become a global trading body in the true sense .
at the invitation of shi guangsheng , moore arrived here on 17 february for a three - day visit .
sino - us relations experienced substantial twists and turns last year .
sino - us relations are now faced with opportunities for further improvement and development . there are also challenges .
we are willing to work with the us side to advance sino - us relations in the direction defined by the presidents of the two countries and toward the goal established by them .
vice premier qian emphatically pointed out : the taiwan issue has always been the most important and the most sensitive issue at the core of sino - us relations .
deputy secretary of state talbott said : the clinton administration is committed to the development of us - china relations .
president clinton is firmly committed to urging the us congress to support permanent normal trade relations with china .
talbott said that the us government opposes the taiwan security enhancement act and will prevent it from becoming law .
beijing , 18 feb (zxs) - - central military commission vice chairman zhang wannian met with deputy secretary of state strobe talbott , us undersecretary of defense walter slocombe , and vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff joseph ralston today .
the two sides talked about the restoration of exchanges and the development of the relations between the chinese and us armed forces .
zhang wannian specially elaborated clearly china 's stand on the taiwan issue , including the issue of us arms sales to taiwan .
today , central foreign affairs office director [ zhong yang wai shi ban gong shi zhu ren 0022 1135 1120 0057 6586 0361 1358 0031 0117 ] liu huaqiu and the chinese people 's liberation army deputy chief of general staff xiong guangkai also separately met with talbott and his party .
both sides expressed the necessity of increasing contacts , enhancing understanding , expanding consensus , and promoting cooperation .
the chinese side pointed out that the development and deployment of national and theater missile defense systems are not conducive to the global strategic balance and not conducive to regional peace and stability .
" the day when china joins the wto will be an important day . "
before that , he was the prime minister , associate minister of foreign affairs and trade , and minister of foreign affairs and trade of new zealand .
he was elected member of new zealand 's parliament at 23 and was the youngest member of the parliament in new zealand 's history .
during his three - day visit to china , his main purpose is to look into the remaining obstacles to china 's accession to the wto , so that he can coordinate all parties concerned to accelerate the process of china 's accession .
moore said he was optimistic about china 's accession to the wto within this year .
he said , currently , all parties concerned hope that a final decision will be made within this year on china 's accession to the wto , and the secretariat of the wto will do its best to accelerate the consultative process .
moore took note of the opportunities and difficulties china will face after it joins the wto as a developing country .
but , after china 's accession to the wto , its problems will not disappear . china 's state - owned enterprises need to enhance their competitiveness and some industries will face competitions .
he expressed the belief that , with the chinese people 's wisdom and industriousness , china 's future is bright .
he said " this is an economic issue and more a development issue . "
according to cao siyuan , china 's accession to the wto will bring about five big changes : 1 .
promotion of trade liberalization after its entry to the wto , china and the more than 130 wto members will give each other favorable treatment in terms of trade .
promotion of investment liberalization the wto wants to break down not only trade barriers , but also investment barriers .
after our accession to the wto , the wto 's operational rules will be applicable to china , and it must ask us to radically improve our environment for investment .
this will open a wide space for soliciting foreign investment .
in the future , apart from sino - foreign joint ventures , sino - foreign cooperative enterprises , and solely - foreign - funded businesses , we must have a new form of foreign investment - - transnational merger and acquisition , that is , merger and acquisition of chinese enterprises by foreign companies .
this will enormously increase the total amount of foreign capital introduced into this country , hopefully from 1998 's $ 45 billion to $ 100 billion in 2005 . 3 .
the overall strength of a country is most primarily manifested by the competitiveness of its enterprises and products .
the competitiveness of enterprises and products , the fine product quality and low prices , and the big market enjoyed by the products represent the most important overall strength of a country .
the most cardinal effect of this convergence is that it will trigger our demand for further reforming the economic structure , government administration , and the entire political system . 5 .
the lowering of tariff rates will lead to a lower price level , either directly or indirectly , thus raising the purchasing power of the money in the hands of consumers .
we should guide the graduates to find jobs in the personnel market and ensure they are employed more rapidly .
localities and departments where conditions permit should actively and steadily promote the method of no guaranteed employment and should gradually establish a new mechanism for placing the graduates , which suits the characteristics of personnel distribution and flow under the condition of the market economy .
when employing the graduates , state administrative organs at all levels should strictly implement the " interim regulations on state public servants " and persist in employment through examination .
they should extend the period for the graduates to choose their own jobs in line with the spirit of relevant state regulations .
personnel service institutions under government personnel departments at and above the county level should serve as a personnel agent for the graduates who return to their native towns without having jobs determined , so that these graduates still can choose their own jobs through the personnel market .
the circular emphasizes : personnel departments at all levels should attach great importance to the employment of graduates , seriously analyze the local situation in this work , and study and resolve new conditions and problems in a timely manner so as to make the work successful .
they should make work procedures public and simplify the procedures for examination and approval to raise work efficiency .
they should actively coordinate with relevant departments to explore and establish the social security system for unemployment insurance and medical service that are closely related with the employment of graduates , so that a realistic and effective guarantee can be provided for the employment of graduates .
personnel departments at all levels should also coordinate and cooperate with education , planning , finance , public security , and grain departments to ensure the smooth progress in the employment of graduates .
guangdong province has made unremitting efforts to investigate and handle large and serious cases .
wang huayuan said : this year guangdong 's discipline inspection and supervision departments will continue to regard investigation of large and serious cases as the priority of the anticorruption work .
meanwhile , they will increase efforts in investigating the law and discipline violations in the financial , securities , and real estate areas , in the approval and transfer of the lease of land , in material procurement , in the judicial area , and in cadre - related personnel work .
beijing , 18 feb - - the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] and the third session of the ninth chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] national committee ( hereinafter referred to as the two sessions ) will open in beijing on 3 march and 5 march , respectively .
in the case of the npc standing committee , however , it is the vice chairman who delivers the report , while the chairman presides over the session .
president jiang forwarded an eight - point proposal for developing cross - strait relations in the current stage and for advancing the process of reunifying the motherland through peaceful means .
in june 1983 , mr. deng xiaoping proposed six concepts on taiwan policy for achieving the motherland 's peaceful reunification , making the concept of " one country , two systems " more specific and systematic .
president jiang 's speech again reiterated the hope of settling the taiwan issue through peaceful means and implementing two systems for one country , that is , the " one country , two systems " concept .
the successive return of hong kong and macao to the motherland marks major progress in the process of the chinese nation 's reunification , has strengthened the confidence of the chinese people 's fervent hope for early settlement of the taiwan issue , and has made the days of achieving the complete reunification of the motherland even more closer .
the smooth reversion of hong kong and macao should be a mirror . the confidence of hong kong and macao compatriots has been enhanced tremendously compared to that in 1996 .
in the activity , the news units have brought into full play the superiority of our party 's propaganda work and this is indeed a beneficial try at loudly singing the keynote ; taking the initiative to fight a battle ; persisting in positive education ; and upholding healthy tendencies .
luo gan pointed out : serving the people heart and soul has all along remained our party 's aim .
xu xingwei ( deputy departmental level ) , former deputy general manager of the chang cheng special steel ( group ) company under the sichuan provincial investment group , was suspected of abusing his authority and ganging up with others to embezzle 380,000 yuan , of which 160,000 were pocketed by himself .
for many developing countries , inequality and aggravation of poverty marked the past 10 years .
due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the south and the north .
according to a statistical report , the number of the most undeveloped countries has increased from 29 in 1976 to 48 at present .
according to research released recently by the united nations conference on trade and development , only $ 13 billion would be required to provide basic medical care for all people in the most undeveloped countries . this figure is merely equivalent to the cost of feeding pets in the united states and western european countries in a year .
looking at the problem from a historical point of view , the developed countries have the responsibility and obligation to provide aid to those developing countries .
it can be said that without frenzied plundering in earlier years , developed countries could not have been so prosperous today .
however , the actual situation is that the development aid is not satisfactory in amount , content , and types .
first of all , the developed countries ' aid has not reached the standard of 0.7 percent of their gnp , and the amount has been decreasing in recent years .
owing to inadequate funds , those development aids can only be used to cover the deficits of the most undeveloped countries and cannot be truly used for development .
besides , in providing aid , western countries often put forward many harsh terms on democratization , political system , judicial independence and human rights issues . sometimes , those countries even clearly limit the use of funds .
this kind of practice of " meddling in others ' affairs " not only will be suspected of interfering in internal affairs of other countries , but will often be divorced from the national situation of receiving countries or even bring disasters to receiving countries .
of course , in the face of future challenges , developing countries should also look reality in the face , strengthen internal unity , give full play to their own advantages , and accelerate their pace of development while trying to obtain more and reasonable foreign aid .
beijing , 20 feb ( xinhua ) - - through the efforts of more than 100 experts in nearly one year , the water conditions of the huang he have basically been determined , thus providing a basis for decision - making in the task of harnessing the flood problems of the huang he .
historically , many floods have occurred at the huang he , china 's second - largest river .
the water conditions of the huang he , especially issues that concern the strategy for harnessing the river 's water volume , standards for floods , and balance of supply and demand of its water resources have attracted much attention .
besides , the experts have calculated the volume of water flow during the river 's biggest floods in the lower reaches seen in 1,000 years and in 100 years .
the completion of the xiaolangdi project and the joint operation of the dams at sanmen gorge , luhun , and guxian will minimize the biggest flood in 1,000 years at the huangyuankou section to 22,600 cubic meters per second and the flood in 100 years to 15,700 cubic meters per second .
the experts have obtained the data for a balanced supply and demand of the huang he 's water resources and the forecast for water shortage .
new investigations show that the amount of water drawn for use by relevant national economic departments in the huang he valley and relevant areas is about 50 billion cubic meters . however , the actual water consumption is about 40 billion cubic meters , and the consumption of water from various rivers is about 30 billion cubic meters .
over the past year or so , under the cpccc 's leadership , party committees at various levels have strengthened their leadership , made arrangements meticulously , and done solid work to ensure a smooth and healthy development of the " three stresses " education .
the overwhelming majority of comrades are politically reliable , work seriously and diligently , and constantly make progress in various aspects .
they are in the prime of life , have received a relatively high level of education , are relatively active in thinking , dare to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit , and have done much hard work to implement the party 's line and central policy - decisions , and to promote socialist modernization .
however , it is also necessary to be aware that some clear weak points and shortcomings also exist among some cadres at this level .
a considerable portion of these comrades have problems here and there to varying degrees in party character and party style , and the problems of some comrades are even relatively serious .
therefore , it is imperative to seriously do a good job in conducting the " three stresses " education at the county ( city ) level .
first of all , it is necessary to gain a thorough understanding of the central spirit and deepen the understanding of the importance and necessity of the " three stresses " education .
on this basis , it is necessary to study intensely and carefully the books on the compulsory list according to the requirements for study stipulated by the central committee .
in carrying out " three stresses ' education in counties ( cities ) in a profound and down - to - earth manner , it is necessary to use the weapon of criticism and self - criticism to conduct positive and healthy ideological struggle .
an important reason is a lack of positive and healthy ideological struggle within the party and the failure to conduct criticism and self - criticism .
whether we can seriously and earnestly conduct criticism and self - criticism will directly affect the quality of the " three stresses " education .
we must resolutely overcome the anxieties of facing embarrassment and pains , and must open up our minds , address problems directly , dare to point out weakness , and seriously dissect ourselves .
in conducting criticism , we must be serious and earnest as well as enthusiastic and friendly with people .
we must communicate our thinking and enhance understanding through heart - to - heart talks .
we must seek truth from facts to reach the goal of clearly identifying the ideology as well as uniting the comrades .
top leaders of counties ( cities ) must directly face the grass - roots . the people may have a little more opinions . however , the leaders must not be too anxious because of this and be afraid to directly conduct " three stresses " education .
our party members and cadres are to serve the people . listening adequately to the people 's opinions is the precondition and basis for offering good service to them .
we must correctly handle the people 's opinions and use them as a driving force to improve our work . we will then continue to improve on our ideology and work .
if possible , we must immediately rectify problems the people are concerned about so that they will continue to see the results of the " three stresses " education , thus enhancing their confidence in the " three stresses " education .
the members of the standing committee of the cpccc political bureau have shown us an example by engaging in mobilization activities for deepening the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) .
we must closely integrate the " three stresses " education into the promotion of current tasks so as " not to delay but improve the education and current tasks . "
on the morning of 20 february , chi haotian went to the zhuhai base of the pla macao garrison to visit officers and soldiers there .
he said : the historical contributions made by the pla hong kong garrison and the pla macao garrison will shine forever in the annals of the pla 's history . during his inspection , chi haotian respectively heard briefings presented by leaders of the garrisons .
upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the army represents our fundamental principle and our everlasting military spirit .
chi haotian said : the key to building qualified military units lies in building well leading groups of the party committees .
leading cadres at all levels should be clean , honest , and industrious . we should strive to increase the party committees ' rally force and fighting capacity .
chi haotian particularly stressed the importance of administrating the armed forces along legal lines and being strict with them .
he said : the basic requirement for the pla hong kong garrison and the pla macao garrison as well as for the whole army is this : they should have rigid military discipline , appearance , and bearing . they should have enthusiastic and lofty spirit . they should have civilized manner .
zhu rongji fully affirmed the achievements scored in customs work .
comrade jiang zemin 's remark greatly jolted and produced a profound impact in the nation .
under the arrangements of the political and law departments , the customs sector firmly implemented the cpc central committee 's major policies and , together with relevant departments , launched a large - scale special drive against smuggling , scoring marked results and dealing a quick , heavy blow to smugglers .
thanks to stepped up collection and management of customs duties , to strict customs duties calculation , and to in - depth checks , customs revenue went up greatly .
at the same time , reform and building of the customs sector have made major progress .
first , it is necessary to continuously intensify anti - smuggling efforts , always keep up the pressure on smugglers , not to let up the effort , guard against smuggling , deal a heavy blow to smuggling , and never to allow the relapse of smuggling activities .
second , it is necessary to manage tax collection according to law , strictly supervise and manage tax collection , ensure collection of taxes that should be collected , and ensure fulfilling tax collection tasks .
third , reform needs to be deepened and modernization of customs system should be enhanced .
reform of customs clearance should be a starting point for the comprehensive promotion of various reforms .
a good job needs to be continuously done in establishing computer networks , in accelerating realization of computerization in customs management , particularly in giving full play to the role of a " national customs declaration form checking system , " and in accelerating the development of the " computerized law enforcement system at the nation 's ports . "
problems as exposed in the ranks of customs departments need to be correctly recognized .
corruption cases must be thoroughly investigated and corrupt elements should be severely punished according to law .
unhealthy tendencies at various trades and professions need to be rectified in a down - to - earth manner . all customs personnel must be absolutely fair in enforcing the law .
all customs departments must enhance and improve internal management and concentrate efforts on doing well in management .
since the introduction of the reform and opening - up policy , gaozhou has made noticeable achievements in economic development and social progress thanks to the guidance of the party 's reform and opening - up policies and the arduous efforts made by the broad masses of the cadres and the people there .
on the morning of 20 february , jiang zemin heard reports by the gaozhou city party committee and government on party building and on preparations for conducting the " three stresses " education .
on the same afternoon , the gaozhou city party committee held the " three stresses " education meeting of leading cadres . over 600 people , including town - level party and government leading cadres in gaozhou , attended the meeting .
the " three stresses " education is aimed at pushing the party building forward and further making ideological , political , and organizational preparations for the party to advance forward in the new century .
jiang zemin stressed that working in line with the tasks of the party for a certain historical period of time , upgrading the cadres ' ideological and political levels through concentrated study and education , and resolving the conspicuous problems within the party are effective methods that our party takes to strengthen self - construction .
historical experiences proved that the party building passes through the entire course which the party leads the people to fight ceaselessly ; it also provides powerful guarantees for the realization of the fighting goal of the party .
through the education , the standing committee members all maintained that conscientiously summing up work , strictly conducting self - analysis , and conscientiously hearing the opinions by the comrades and the masses help strengthen the accomplishment and practice of party spirit , improve ideological and political levels , and intensify and improve work .
the party committees at various levels should pay attention to linking the " three stresses " education with the promotion of reform , development , and stability in the current stage .
meanwhile , standing in the forefront of the education and with the heavy task of reform , opening up , and construction , county ( city ) leaders should firmly take economic construction as a center and carefully arrange and realistically and firmly achieve the work in all areas .
jiang zemin accented that the first 20 years of the 21 st century is the most important period of developing the undertaking of the party and the people , as well as one to train the cadres at the county ( city ) level , to enrich their experience , and to bring their talents into play .
only when counties ( cities ) achieve their work will there be a firm foundation of the masses and a firm social foundation for the long - term order and stability of the party and the state .
jiang zemin pointed out that unswervingly implementing the party 's line , policies , and principles to the letter and resolutely carrying out the party 's line , policies , and principles despite repeated setbacks are basic political demands on all leading cadres .
there are over 2,000 counties ( cities ) in china . each county has its own actual conditions . so , we cannot ask all of them to follow the same pattern in implementing the central policies and principles and carrying out the work in all areas .
at present , the agricultural sector has entered a new stage of development , the agricultural sector and town and township enterprises are under restructuring , and the task for increasing the peasants ' incomes is very heavy .
jiang zemin emphasized that the transformation of the objective world and the subjective world is constantly two important tasks ahead of each and every party member and each and every party leading cadre .
the leading cadres at various levels , including county ( city ) leading cadres , should persist in telling truth , work and behave honestly , and insist on self - respect , self - examination , self - vigilance , and self - motivation .
communist party members should further consciously strengthen their ideological accomplishment and the transformation of their own subjective world .
as long as we accurately clarify these questions , then we will be able to behave justly .
chinese foreign minister tang jiaxuan and his iranian counterpart kharrazi held talks in tehran on 20 february .
he said : iranian - chinese relations have solid historical origins and the two countries have made important contributions to mankind 's civilization ; therefore today we should continue to strengthen cooperation .
iran is of the view that no country should impose its own culture and civilization on other countries .
therefore , president khatami proposed dialogue between civilizations , and the international community has positively responded to his proposal .
he said : my visit is to further enhance the mutual understanding and friendship between china and iran and to boost development of bilateral friendly cooperation in all fields .
the " silk road " of the past brought closely together the chinese and iranian civilizations , the two great civilizations of the east .
china is of the view that only by stepping up cooperation and increasing exchanges between countries on the basis of mutual respect and treating each other equally can mutual trust between them be enhanced , can they seek common ground while reserving differences , and can mankind 's civilizations jointly develop and progress .
both china and iran are developing countries of asia and they hold identical or similar views on many important international and regional issues .
in the new century , china will be willing to make joint efforts with iran to continue to cement and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in various fields between our two countries and to endeavor to build long - term , stable , ever - developing , and friendly relations of cooperation between our two countries .
iran expressed its willingness to encourage iranian enterprises to actively take part in developing the western region of china .
it is reported that this southern tour of jiang zemin may be connected with the elevation of shenzhen to a municipality directly under the central government .
in addition , since the march national people 's congress [ npc ] session is imminent , the attention of outsiders has also been aroused by whether this southern trip has anything to do with transferring guangdong provincial cpc committee secretary li changchun .
our reporter yesterday sent a telegram to the propaganda department of the shenzhen city cpc committee to inquire whether jiang zemin 's southern tour is connected with the elevation of shenzhen to a municipality directly under the central government .
according to reports , the time is now near for clinching the elevation of shenzhen to the fifth municipality directly under the central government ; this could happen this year or next , at the earliest .
according to reports , on this southern tour jiang zemin may very well console guangdong to help them understand the central authorities ' intentions and agree to shenzhen 's elevation .
if shenzhen is elevated to this status , its administrative setup will be directly subordinate to the state council leadership , and guangdong 's economic strength will be affected to a greater or lesser extent on account of shenzhen 's " independence . "
according to information , jiang zemin arrived to inspect work in guangdong the day before yesterday .
people concerned have stated that jiang zemin has always attached very great importance to work in guangdong ; when touring guangdong in 1993 , he demanded that guangdong " create new strong points and climb one story higher . "
according to information , during his stay in guangdong , jiang zemin will inspect the army , navy , and air force units stationed in the province .
according to sources , the cpc is now launching the " three stresses " ( study , politics , and healthy atmosphere ) at all levels .
outsiders had previously favored li changchun for transfer to the central authorities sooner or later .
current rumors have it that li changchun may become a vice premier at the npc next month to share responsibility for the work of vice premier wen jiabao , who is reported to be in charge of developing western china .
li changchun was suddenly transferred to the south before the opening of the 1998 npc , and people are watching to see if he will suddenly be transferred north at next month 's npc .
according to information , the cpc central committee has decided that the several million party cadres through the country must take part in study classes to examine themselves , and also accept assessment by their subordinate cadres ; everyone has to pass the test .
beginning yesterday afternoon , workers of the shenzhen railway station were on the platform sweeping the building clean , and maintenance men were repairing the wall around the station ; the stored red carpet had also been moved onto the platform .
according to reports , after arriving in shenzhen , jiang zemin will first hear a work report by city cpc committee secretary zhang gaoli , after which he will inspect some prominent hi - tech enterprises in the city and deliver an important speech to promote high technology as a new development orientation for the sez in the future .
it is reported that an air force division from the jinan military region participated in the exercise , which was conducted after the new year with a view to mustering the fighters of a whole division to engage in long - distance sea - crossing surprise - attack operations .
recently , the pla air force 's drills have been significantly strengthened . according to media reports , the air force conducted an air - to - air combat confrontation exercise on the southeast coast in early November last year .
after graduation , they will be the first to be assigned to key units of the air force .
an official of a department for work toward taiwan pointed out that adjustments of the taiwan policy on a " technical level " show that the mainland 's basic policy toward taiwan will not change and need not be changed .
the mainland 's basic taiwan policy is : pursuing peaceful reunification and " one country , two systems " under the premise of one china , yet without giving up the use of force .
china will make minor adjustments on its taiwan policy because of the following facts : first , the issue of national reunification has entered the third phase . hong kong 's return is the first phase , and macao 's return is the second . taiwan 's reunification with the mainland will be the third and last phase .
second , lee teng - hui 's " two - state theory " further strengthened cpc leaders ' earnest hope that " an early reunification is better than a late one . "
the " eight - point proposal " primarily calls for the realization of cross - strait political negotiations .
after taiwan 's new leaders take power , the premise for resuming cross - strait political dialogue is that the new taiwan leaders must be pragmatic , that is , must not pursue taiwan independence .
since the longer the reunification issue drags on , the more troublesome the issue will become , resolving the taiwan issue at an early date has become the consensus of cpc leaders .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - learned by our reporter from the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation , the import - export operations right to china 's enterprises is being gradually transitioned from the examination and approval system to the registration system .
thus far , all the manufacturing enterprises and the scientific research institutes that meet the criterion have obtained the import - export operations right after registering with the authorities concerned in accordance with the relevant regulations .
as early as in 1996 , the ministry of foreign trade and economic cooperation began implementing the registration system on a trial basis among the manufacturing enterprises in the five economic special zones .
currently , the production enterprises and the scientific research institutes with the right to operate import and export can be found all over the country and in all the national economic spheres .
this move has enabled numerous manufacturing enterprises and scientific research institutes to directly participate in the international competition , thus having helped expand foreign trade and export .
however , such a fair , reasonable , and legitimate regulation was obstructed by a legislative council sub - committee responsible for discussing and examining it and failed to pass through .
as for this , the sar government has reiterated that it will not give up its stand and will submit a new draft regulation to the legislative council for deliberation and examination later on .
first , it should be pointed out that the issue of whether or not the hong kong - based central organs should enjoy immunity is not just an issue on making things faster and more convenient . rather , it is an issue concerning the principle of sovereignty .
this principle has applied to almost all common law jurisdictions , such as britain , new zealand , australia , and so on . "
the fact is crystal clear that the sovereign power 's institutions had enjoyed immunity during the period under the british rule . it is definitely not a new thing that has come up since the handover and nor should it be construed as a " privilege " on the part of the hong kong - based central organs .
the fact is : should they refrain from exercising or inheriting such immunity , the hong kong - based central organs would violate the tradition of legal precedents in a common law jurisdiction and run counter to the basic law .
though the garrison vehicles had a few small accidents , those accidents were properly settled and the garrison has never asked for special treatment or " bullied others with the backing of power . "
beijing has been so short of water resources that recently some media have , on behalf of the water resources bureau , spread the following news : if we are faced with another year of drought , it is likely that there will be no running water in your house .
in the view of qian yi , academician at the chinese academy of engineering and professor at qinghua university , the beijing water crisis has become so serious that it is necessary to consider the issue of moving the capital to another place .
how should we look at such a great disparity ?
as far as i am concerned , i attach more importance to the water shortage than the index .
beijing 's annual average volume of utilizable water resources is about 4.1 billion cubic meters . judging from the existing facilities and management level , this does not come up to the requirements for turning beijing into an international metropolis and a city with first - rate environmental quality .
even if the project to " divert water from the south to the north " is completed in 2010 , it can only provide 1.2 billion cubic meters of water . and the cost is so high that users can hardly afford it .
yan changyuan , director of the beijing municipal bureau of water resources , told beijing reporters that even after a series of measures were taken , the situation in water supply and demand would still be very serious should there be an extremely dry year and should the dry spell go on for several years .
the river courses at the lower reaches are mostly filled with super - category 5 water substances , where basically no organisms can survive .
due to the threat of pollution , the beijing guanting reservoir stopped supplying drinking water in 1997 .
the " general report on planning for the sustainable use of water resources in the capital in the early 21 st century " has named guanting reservoir as a reserve water resource in the event of an emergency .
however , it also stresses the need to speed up silt disposal and polluted water treatment .
last summer and during the spring festival this year , i went twice to hebei , which is the upper reaches of guanting reservoir .
for this reason , moving the capital to another place is not alarmist talk .
china 's cities lack 6 billion cubic meters of water annually , with a daily shortage of more than 16 million cubic meters of water .
at present , the surface water that has become undrinkable due to pollution accounts for 40 percent of monitored waters ; 50 percent of underground waters are polluted ; and 64 percent of people drink water from unfit water resources .
nearly one half of the river segment is polluted , and one tenth of the rivers have been seriously polluted for a long time so that the water has lost its use - value .
according to an expert 's estimate , the peak of china 's water shortage will emerge in 2010 and 2020 .
get into action at once !
no one from the central military commission was with jiang zemin during his current inspection tour of southern china .
however , liu shutian , political commissar of the guangzhou military region , was with jiang zemin where he went .
the sources said jiang zemin may inspect the 42 d army in huiyang .
the passing of the taiwan security enhancement act ( hereinafter referred to as tsea ) by the us house of representatives on 1 january [ as published ] this year has led to china 's solemn representation and caused tension in sino - us relations once again .
actually , an informed source in beijing has revealed that what liu xiaoming has said is exactly what was in the minds of china 's top leaders .
the informed source pointed out : once the united states enacts the tsea into law , beijing will react politically , diplomatically , and militarily in substance .
by that time , it would not be surprising at all to see large - scale nationwide anti - us demonstrations .
- - efforts should be made to strengthen technological innovation , accelerate structural readjustment , and foster a number of enterprise groups and key product r & d bases with international competitiveness in key areas like microelectronics , software , computer and telecommunications .
he said : at present , the " telecommunications regulations " have been submitted for review , the work of drafting the " telecommunications law " is being carried out in earnest , and the revision of the " postal law " and its rules of implementation as well as the " radio regulations " are under way .
wu jichuan said that efforts must be made to gradually develop business competition of different forms and at different levels in the sphere of telecommunications and establish a fair and effective framework of market competition through macro - control and the monitoring of market operations .
he disclosed that china was in the process of speeding up the building of a national internet switching center . the beijing internet center will be completed in the first quarter of this year and plans for the building of other regional internet centers are under way .
on the question of standardizing the market for electronic and information products , wu jichuan said that the departments concerned were trying their best to supplement and improve the rules and regulations for market management and rectify improper competition between enterprises , and were intensifying their fight against dumping , monopoly and smuggling .
he said : china 's entry into the wto is an opportunity as well as a challenge for the information industry .
beijing , 21 february ( xinhua ) - - in may last year , the cpc central committee and the state council issued a circular , imposing a strict prohibition on building facilities commemorating late leading comrades .
over the past years , center - approved facilities commemorating revolutionaries of the older generation have played an important role in educating cadres and ordinary people at large , especially young people , on revolutionary traditions and patriotism .
however , these central regulations still have not been satisfactorily implemented in some localities , and the phenomenon of unauthorized building of facilities commemorating late leading comrades has been becoming ever more serious in a few localities .
to resolutely stop the above - mentioned bad practices , the circular reiterated and issued the following injunctions : 1 . cpc committees , governments , and cpc - member leading comrades at large of all levels should fully understand the important significance of the center 's decision to prohibit the unauthorized building of facilities commemorating late leading comrades .
our party is a party which serves the people whole - heartedly , and the nature and purpose of the party have determined that the party must proceed on the basis of promoting the people 's interest and aim to promote the people 's interest .
late leading comrades ' purpose of joining the revolution was to promote the people 's interest , instead leaving behind commemorating establishments showing their contributions after their death .
as per capita farmland is small in the first place , the unauthorized use of farmland , forest land , or even land in scenic areas for building tombs of late leading comrades not only constitutes a serious wasting of land and other resources , but is also a practice which is very irresponsible to the future generations .
deng xiaoping 's exemplary conduct of making immortal contributions to the party and the nation and simplifying his funeral built an eternal monument in the hearts of the masses of the people and set a glorious example for the entire party and the entire country .
in the two years and more since comrade deng xiaoping 's death , some localities have proposed to build facilities commemorating comrade deng xiaoping . but , members of comrade deng xiaoping 's family proposed to the center many times that no facilities commemorating comrade deng xiaoping be built .
in the absence of the cpc central committee 's and the state council 's planning and arrangements , no locality or unit shall build or expand any late leading comrade 's memorial hall , memorial pavilion , monument , tomb park , tomb , statue , former residence , or any other commemorative facility .
late leading comrades ' ashes should be appropriately placed in accordance wit the relevant rules .
late leading comrades ' ashes which are in the babaoshan revolutionary cemetery of beijing or revolutionary cemeteries of other cities should , as a general rule , not be moved to other places for burial or placement purposes .
with regard to approved requests made by late leading comrades ' families to move the ashes to other places for burial or placement purposes , it is necessary to finish all such moving at one time .
cpc committees , governments , and relevant departments at all levels should uphold principles , persist in acting in accordance with the rules , and never give any unauthorized approval for or carry out any unauthorized construction of any commemorative facility because of personal relationships .
if some members of late leading comrades ' families or staffs reject the advice , pressure the localities , and obstinately demand the establishment of facilities commemorating the late leading comrades , such persons ' work units should seriously handle the cases .
no unit or individual shall gather funds , impose levies , collect contributions , or solicit sponsorship in the name of building or expanding commemorative facilities . 6 .
the late leading comrades discussed in this paper refer to comrades who held leadership positions of the provincial - ministerial level before their death , the circular pointed out .
in regard to the building of facilities commemorating other late leading comrades , the spirit of this circular should be followed where appropriate .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - today , the state council taiwan affairs office and state council information office issued a white paper entitled " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue . "
this white paper is comprised of five sections as well as a preface and concluding remarks .
the " preface " points out that resolving the taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of china is in the fundamental interests of the chinese nation .
the chinese government has been consistent from beginning to end in upholding the one - china principle and resolutely opposing any attempts to separate taiwan from china .
the struggle between the chinese government and those splittist forces led by li teng - hui is mainly manifest on the issue of upholding one - china principle or creating " two chinas " and " one china , one taiwan . "
therefore , it is necessary to further explain the standpoints and policies of the chinese government about upholding one - china principle to the international community .
on the day of its establishment , the central people 's government of the people 's republic of china proclaimed to governments of all countries : " this government is the only legitimate government representing all the people in the people 's republic of china .
this government is willing to establish diplomatic relations with governments of any foreign countries on the basis of equality , mutual benefit , and mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity . "
the principle of new china for establishing diplomatic relations with foreign countries is that foreign countries must recognize the government of the people 's republic of china to be the only legitimate government representing whole china and sever or not establish diplomatic relations with taiwan authorities .
it is exactly in the developments of normal diplomatic relations between china and foreign countries and the struggles for safeguarding china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity that this one - china principle was produced .
the above - mentioned propositions constitute the basic connotation of this one - china principle with safeguarding china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity as its core .
the just stand and reasonable proposition of the chinese government about upholding one - china principle have won the understanding and support of more and more countries and international organizations and this one - china principle has gradually generally accepted by the international community .
at present , there are 161 countries which have established diplomatic relations with the people 's republic of china and all recognized the one - china principle and agreed to handle its relations with taiwan within the one - china framework .
this basic principle and relevant policies have fulfilled the basic standpoint and spirit of upholding one - china principle and fully respected the wishes of taiwan compatriots for being masters of their own destiny and running taiwan themselves .
the announcement of the chinese government in 1979 about implementing the guiding principle of peaceful reunification was based on one precondition : namely the taiwan authorities at that time upheld that there was only one china in the world and taiwan was part of china .
while adopting the guiding principle of peaceful reunification , the chinese government always indicates that using whatever patterns to resolve taiwan issue is the internal affairs of china and undertakes no obligation to renounce use of force .
undertaking no obligation to renounce use of force is absolutely not directed against taiwan compatriots but those foreign forces attempting to create " taiwan independence " and interfering with the reunification of china .
as far as taiwan is concerned , upholding the one - china principle demonstrates recognizing the inseparability of the sovereignty and territory of china , which provides a common basis and precondition for both sides to find out methods of resolving their political disagreements through consultations on equal footing and realize peaceful reunification .
if this one - china principle is not recognized but attempts are made to separate taiwan from the chinese territory , this precondition and basis for peaceful reunification does not exist anymore .
countries concerned all upholding the one - china policy is favorable to safeguarding peace and stability in the asian pacific region as well as china developing friendly relations with all countries , which is in the interests of the asian pacific region as well as all countries in the world .
the chinese government hopes that on the basis of one - china principle , the two sides can hold consultations on equal footing to jointly discuss issues of reunification .
in his book of " taiwan propositions " published in may , he advocated dividing china into seven regions each enjoying " full autonomous rights . "
li teng - hui has become the chief representative of taiwan splittist forces , the destroyer of stability in the taiwan strait , the obstacle to the development of sino - us relations , and the trouble - maker for the peace and stability in the asian pacific region .
against all kinds of these splittist activities by taiwan splittist forces represented by li teng - hui , the chinese government and people have always maintained sharp vigilance and waged resolute struggles .
this struggle has demonstrated the firm resolution and capability of the chinese government and people in safeguarding state sovereignty and territorial integrity and produced important and far - reaching influences .
internationally , these splittist activities conducted by li teng - hui were also met with severe hits .
most countries in the world have reiterated upholding the one - china policy .
and the us government also reaffirmed upholding one - china policy and its promise of giving " three no supports " to taiwan .
and the taiwan authorities have also been forced to express not to revise its so - called " constitution " and " laws " in accordance with the " state - to - state theory . "
on the territory of a single country , there can be only one central government exercising sovereignty on behalf of that state .
it is necessary to resolutely oppose applying the pattern of referendum to change the status of taiwan being part of china .
if anyone attempts to apply the pattern of so - called referendum to separate taiwan from china , it will surely lead taiwan people into disasters .
the " module of two germanies " cannot be used in resolving taiwan issue .
the split of germany after world war ii and the temporary detachment across the taiwan strait are issues of different nature .
the issue of germany was created entirely by external factors .
and taiwan issue is left over by the chinese civil wars and an internal issue .
the split of germany were stipulated by a series of international treaties signed during and after world war ii .
and taiwan issue was stipulated by some international treaties like " cairo declaration , " " potsdam proclamation , " and so on that japan must return taiwan which it stole from china back to china .
against the background of confrontation between the united states and the soviet union , the two germanies which had respectively foreign troops stationed in their territories were forced to recognize each other and coexisted in the international community .
under the principle of one china , everything can be discussed .
the so - called " struggle of democracy and system " is only an excuse for obstructing the reunification of china .
moreover , the chinese government has also noticed the different features of taiwan to hong kong and macao , and after peaceful reunification is realized across the taiwan strait , taiwan can be more relaxed than hong kong and macao in terms of the content of " one country , two systems . "
in the fifth section entitled " certain issues relating to the international community in upholding the one - china principle , " the white paper points out : taiwan does not have the right to join the united nations nor any other international organizations which can only be joined by sovereignty states .
as for some governmental international organizations which allow regions to join , on the basis of one - china principle and in accordance with the natures , charters , and actual conditions of these relevant international organizations , the chinese government can allow arrangement for the participation of taiwan by agreeable and acceptable patterns .
those countries which have already established diplomatic relations with china cannot sell weapons to taiwan nor enter into any forms of military alliance .
the united states has repeatedly violated its solemn promise made in the " august 17 communique . "
to this , the chinese government resolutely opposes .
the chinese government applies one - china principle in treating the external activities of taiwan .
the chinese government protects all the rightful and legitimate rights and interests of taiwan compatriots in foreign countries .
the chinese embassies and consulates stationed in foreign countries have always regarded strengthening contacts with taiwan compatriots , listening to the opinions and demands of taiwan compatriots , and protecting the interests of taiwan compatriots as their own duties and tried to help them clear away difficulties as much as possible .
after the realization of cross - strait reunification , taiwan compatriots can share more dignity and honor of the people 's republic of china in the international community together with the people of all nationalities in the whole country .
in its closing remarks , this white paper entitled " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " points out : the 5,000 - year - long chinese history and culture has deeply planted a very strong national sense in the hearts of the chinese people : namely , china must be reunified .
we firmly believe that with the joint endeavor of all the chinese people in the whole country which include compatriots living on both sides of the taiwan strait and overseas chinese abroad , the complete reunification of china will surely be realized .
chairman li peng chaired the meeting .
explanations and briefings on relevant topics were offered separately by he chunlin , secretary general of the npc standing committee ; wang weicheng , chairman of the npc law committee and chairman of the npc standing committee 's credential committee ; and yu youmin , deputy secretary general of the npc standing committee .
government departments and various circles in the society have gradually gained a common understanding in the impact of " entry into wto " : a short - term shock will be unavoidable , but judging from a long - term point of view advantages will be greater than disadvantages .
china 's entry into wto will certainly promote china 's link with the world economy and strengthen foreign businessmen 's confidence in making investment in china . it will create a more stable outside environment for china 's economic development and help china realize the strategic goal of a sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy .
during this period , china can take advantage of the wto regulations to develop , protect , and improve ourselves by accelerating reform , improving management , optimally allocating natural resources , raising the technological level , and strengthening market participation and capacity to cope with risks .
we should also see that china 's entry into wto can bring opportunities for our textile , light industry , clothing industry , machinery and electrical appliances industry , and other labor - intensive industries to develop their international market and extricate themselves from limitations due to discriminatory policies .
besides , " entry into wto " can enable china to utilize two kinds of markets and two types of natural resources at home and abroad to promote the escalation of our industries and eliminate backward enterprises .
in the mean time , npc deputies and cppcc national committee members will pay attention to reinforcing , adjusting and improving laws and regulations involving foreign countries , using law to guarantee the implementation of stipulations of wto and reducing administrative interference .
the party organizations at all levels must regard the study of " the expositions of mao zedong , deng xiaoping , and jiang zemin on ideological and political work " as an important aspect of the party members ' and cadres ' study this year , include it in their plans , and make scientific arrangements for it .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - the sixth meeting of the china - india joint committee for science , technology , economy , and trade was held at the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade (mofert) this morning .
today 's joint committee meeting was jointly presided over by shi guangsheng and indian minister for commerce and industry murasoli maran .
he said : after china joins the wto , china and india will be able to cooperate within the wto and work together to build a new order of world trade .
after joining the wto , china will learn from india 's experience of success in meeting both the opportunity and challenge offered by the wto membership .
the chinese and indian ministers made these remarks at the 6 th session of the sino - indian technology , economy and trade mixed commission held here today .
in 1999 , the bilateral trade volume between the two countries was nearly $ 2 billion , up 3.4 percent from 1998 .
as of the end of 1999 , the agreed amount of china 's investment in india was $ 24.6 million . konka [ shenzhen konka electronic ( group ) company , ltd. ] and haier [ the haier group ] have already set up plants in india .
shi guangsheng believes that the bilateral trade volume is far from meeting the needs of the two sides and is way below the actual capacity .
maran emphasized that the indian government attaches importance to developing firm and stable relations with china , is devoted to increasing bilateral trade volume , and hopes to promote cooperation in the fields in which both sides are interested .
beijing , 21 feb ( xinhua ) - - yesterday , the taiwan affairs office of the state council and the information office of the state council jointly issued the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue . "
the white paper is a proclamation that has further expounded to the international community the chinese government 's adherence to the one - china principled stand and policy , and is also a declaration on the chinese people 's determination to settle the taiwan issue and realize the complete reunification of the motherland at an early date .
after the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland one after the other , the settlement of the taiwan issue and the realization of the complete reunification of the motherland have entered a new stage .
the main theme idea that the one - china policy is the basis and prerequisite for the realization of peaceful reunification runs through the whole document .
adhering to the one - china principle in dealing with cross - strait affairs , especially in cross - strait talks , before reunification means adhering to the principles that there is only one china in the world , taiwan is a part of china , and china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be divided .
we have proposed holding cross - strait dialogue and talks on the basis of the one - china principle , not mentioning " talks between the central and local governments , " negotiating between the two sides on an equal footing and jointly discussing reunification .
however , the danger of the separatist forces in taiwan attempting to separate taiwan " de jure " from the motherland still exists .
separating the motherland and seeking " taiwan independence " mean heading for war .
we believe and hope that taiwan compatriots , who choose peaceful reunification of the two sides of the strait , can see through the lies and make a wise choice of their own .
all these situations remind us yet again that we must be highly vigilant , uphold the principle of one china , resolutely oppose " taiwan independence " and scheming by taiwan splittist forces , and oppose foreign hostile forces ' intervention in the taiwan issue and their interference in china 's internal affairs .
we hope the us government will faithfully abide by the three sino - us joint communiques and fulfill its " three noes " commitment with regard to taiwan .
we believe the international community will persistently adhere to the policy of one china and support china 's undertaking of peaceful reunification .
the principle of one china must never waver and the sacred goal of reunification must be achieved .
all chinese people at home and abroad must unite , uphold the principle of one china , and strive hard to promote the accomplishment of the great cause of motherland reunification .
in 1983 , he fled to japan after being wanted for a larceny case and a bill deception case . later on , he traveled between singapore , thailand , the mainland , and some other places with several forged passports . last may , he was arrested in xiamen for using someone else 's taiwan travel documents .
wu bangguo , member of the cpc central committee 's political bureau and vice premier of the state council , on 21 february met members of the japanese delegation that has offered assistance in sponsoring the beijing international highway relay race .
at the request of the guests , wu bangguo briefed them the situation of the reform of china 's state - owned enterprises , progress in joining wto and other matters .
the beijing international highway relay race sponsored by the beijing municipal association for promoting friendship with foreign countries and the china track and field association started on 20 february . athletes from 14 countries including china , japan , dprk , vietnam , russia and denmark are taking part in the race .
since the early 1990 s , lee teng - hui gradually has deviated from the one - china principle , advocating all sorts of separatist arguments and conniving at and providing support for the " taiwan independence " separatist forces .
in ideology and culture , the taiwan authorities have endeavored to obliterate the chinese awareness of taiwan compatriots , especially the younger generation , and their identification with the motherland .
the chinese government and people have fought more resolutely after lee teng - hui cooked up his " two states " theory . the struggle has grown in momentum with chinese at home and abroad condemning the " two states " theory with one voice , and enabled the international community to strengthen its consensus on one china .
the white paper is also firmly opposed to the erroneous us practice of wantonly interfering in china 's internal affairs and threatening china 's security , such as selling arms to taiwan and cooking up the " taiwan security enhancement act. "
the principle of one china is the foundation of and precondition for achieving peaceful reunification .
from 1978 , when the separation between the two sides of the strait ended , to the end of 1999 , cross - strait personnel exchanges , economic cooperation , and trade advanced by leaps and bounds .
the white paper stresses : as the chinese government has resumed the exercise of sovereignty over hong kong and macao , the people of the whole country are eager to resolve the taiwan issue at an early date and to realize the total reunification of the motherland .
we hope that more taiwan compatriots will come to hong kong and macao to have a look and personally experience the rationality and feasibility of the " one country , two systems " principle .
the 5,000 - year - long history and culture of the chinese nation has profoundly implanted strong national awareness in the hearts of the chinese , namely , china must be reunified .
the principle and stand of the chinese government and people , as openly declared in the white paper , is precisely a firm expression of such national awareness . it is also an irreversible trend of history that china will realize total reunification .
if the talks proceed smoothly , eu trade commissioner pascal lamy will fly to beijing later in the week for the signing of an accord .
in the previous round of technical talks , china and the eu had reached an agreement on most of the issues related to market access , but differences remained on the opening of the automobile and insurance markets , service trade , and tariffs on nearly 100 categories of commodities .
it is understood that the eu asking price for market opening in these areas is higher than that of the united states .
experts here are generally optimistic about the sino - eu agreement on china 's wto accession , holding that it is very likely to be reached this week .
among the remaining negotiating partners , the eu evidently will be a major obstacle .
in a meeting on 17 february with the visiting wto director - general , mike moore , chinese state council premier zhu rongji expressed the hope that there would be " breakthrough progress " in the forthcoming sino - eu talks .
the sources told our reporters that on the eve of the " two sessions " of the npc and the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] , it is a rare occurrence for the central authorities to carry out a " major reshuffle " in financial circles .
it is beyond expectation for such sudden personnel changes to take place in the four major banks ( the bank of china , china construction bank , industrial and commercial bank of china , and china agricultural development bank ) .
this will enable the relevant central departments to investigate their economic problems .
liu mingkang , chairman of the everbright group , will replace wang xuebing and become acting president of the bank of china .
shang fulin , vice governor of the people 's bank of china , will replace he linxiang and become president of the agricultural bank of china .
jiang jianqing , executive vice president of the industrial and commercial bank of china , will be promoted to president of the bank .
The advanced model of culture is the vanguard of the development of China's cultural undertakings .
the experience created by and the pioneering spirit shown by these culturally advanced examples are the motivation and spiritual pillar for the further development of our country 's cultural causes .
we must study their excellent working styles of going deep into the grassroots , keeping links with the masses , being united and cooperating with others . we must trigger the innovative spirit and working drive of the broad masses of cultural workers .
now it is at the turn of centuries and millennia . in the great era of building socialism with chinese characteristics , we have much to do in our cultural work .
wang sheng , research fellow of the institute of taiwan studies under the chinese academy of social sciences , also pointed out that the statement " without the principle of ' one china , ' one cannot start to talk about peaceful reunification " serves as the core idea of the newly released white paper .
professor dai wenbin , research fellow of the institute of taiwan studies under the chinese academy of social sciences , used an eight - character phrase of " preventing further delay and propelling progress " to sum up the special significance of the newly released white paper .
speaking of some people in taiwan who consider the newly released white paper as " striking up the same old tune , " wang sheng pointed out that these people have failed to grasp the true essence of the white paper .
professor su ge further pointed out : the one - china principle is a principle that the chinese government and chinese people have long been safeguarding with resolute and firm efforts .
professor wang sheng also pointed out during the exclusive interview : it was exactly based on the prerequisite of an adherence to the " one - china " principle by the taiwan authorities that the chinese government put forward the principle of " peaceful reunification , one country two systems " in 1979 .
in 1993 when the taiwan authorities showed signs of a deviation from the " one - china " principle , the mainland motherland heightened its vigilance .
the white paper set forth three prerequisites for the use of force .
the white paper announces that if taiwan refuses , sine die , to participate in peace talks , then that is a prerequisite for the use of force , and rightly so .
on the other hand , it also serves as a signal telling the contenders running for the leadership of taiwan that defining cross - strait relations by basing them on the " two - state theory " and sabotaging the reunification of the motherland will be resolutely opposed .
people in the political circle reiterated : first , the chinese government has been consistent in upholding a positive and sincere attitude in the drive of peacefully resolving the taiwan issue .
fourth , the chinese government announced the principle of peaceful reunification under the consideration of a better external environment at that time , where the united states established ties with china , signed three joint communiques , and admitted the principle of one china .
however , although the joint communiques were signed , the united states has been repeatedly violating the communiques and continuously sold advanced weapons to taiwan .
currently , in the us congress , some people are concocting the so - called " taiwan security enhancement act , " and attempting to include taiwan in the theater missile defense system .
the moves of the united states are not advantageous to china 's cause of resolving the taiwan issue in a peaceful manner .
fifth , under the principle of one china , any questions can be discussed .
beijing , 22 feb ( xinhua ) - - the people 's liberation army [ pla ] general political department recently issued a circular calling on the whole army and the armed police force to conscientiously study the book on " the expositions of mao zedong , deng xiaoping and jiang zemin on ideological and political work . "
we should realistically give priority to ideological and political work in the army 's various development fields , and persist in attaining higher standards and setting stricter demands in ideological and political work .
we should deeply summarize and absorb experiences and lessons from the struggles in the ideological and political field , study and come forward with specific measures for strengthening and improving ideological and political work and grasp them with earnest efforts .
over the past nearly 50 years since it was established , stationed at some 38 airfields one after another , it has flown some 17 types of planes .
in particular , mao zedong , deng xiaoping , jiang zemin , and other state leaders have cordially met with officers and men of " du fengrui group " on numerous occasions . the group has also been an advanced unit for 20 consecutive years and has rendered meritorious service or received awards on countless occasions .
last october , a team sent by the division won the group championship in a large - scale training contest organized by the air force among maintenance units .
the division was also chosen by the general staff department as a first - class military training unit .
in particular , the division has fulfilled the largest number of combat exercise tasks with the best results .
in a major exercise organized by the nanjing theater in the third quarter of last year , the division 's units kept a close watch on and patrolled over the taiwan straits , thus demonstrating a strong fighting capacity of defending the country 's sovereignty and dignity .
especially , it has stepped up tactical and technological training on some extremely difficult topics and scored fruitful results .
on their way back , as it was raining heavily , the visibility extremely low .
two minutes later , all the four planes smoothly landed one after another and this attested to the pilots ' excellent flight skills and bold , vigorous , and brave fighting style .
in light of the needs of a war , it has conducted training on transregional rapid mobility and long - distance strikes ; tempered its pilots ' fighting will ; and trained its pilots ' fighting style .
it has studied and developed a whole set of new tactics , such as confrontation on the sea , surprise attack on the sea , preemptive attack on the enemy , hitting all targets during the first strike , and so on .
all its pilots have learned and mastered with excellent results both flexible and variable tactics and the law of defeating the enemy and winning a victory .
not long ago , in a live - fire training exercise organized by the higher authorities , in which missiles were fired at air targets , the division 's 10 new pilots buckled on their armor and went into the battle and scored excellent results by hitting all the targets during the first strike .
division commander zhang and political commissar su told us that they are fully confident of the division 's fighting capacity .
a few days ago , vice mayor of xiamen city lan fu , who fled to australia last month because of his being implicated in the xiamen yuanhua smuggling case , surrendered to the chinese embassy in australia . he was escorted back to beijing by chinese police and detained at the qincheng prison .
in early january , xiamen vice mayor lan fu , accompanied by his wife who worked in the state security bureau in xiamen city , left the country through shanghai customs and fled to australia .
on 30 january 1995 , president jiang zemin published his important speech entitled " continue to strive for the completion of the great reunification cause of the motherland . "
however , awed by this development in the cross - strait situation , the splittist forces on the taiwan island became more reckless in carrying out their splittist activities , in an attempt to prevent the development of the cross - strait relations from moving towards the orientation advocated in the eight - point proposal .
under our stern criticisms , the " two - state theory " has not only given rise to new political struggles and contradictions on the taiwan island ; but has all the more faced a boycott in the international community , and more than 100 countries have reiterated their stand to uphold their one - chinapolicy .
lee teng - hui 's " two - state theory " has turned him into an unpopular " troublemaker . "
the industrial and commercial circles have all the more made a greater appeal for changing the policy of " refraining from impetuosity and exercising forbearance " which is currently pursued by the taiwan authorities .
meanwhile , the trend toward a mutually complementary and mutually beneficial economic cooperation across the strait is currently undergoing further growth .
we deeply believe that a complete reunification of the motherland can surely become a reality .
increasing numbers of our taiwan compatriots are gaining an ever deeper understanding of and identification with " one country , two systems " through its practice in hong kong and macao , now gradually deciding that " one country , two systems " is the best way to defend their interests in all areas .
since china will have to achieve complete reunification for the taiwan strait and the asia pacific region to have real peace and stability and for the basic interests of the taiwan people to not be possibly infringed upon , national reunification is in the real interests of the taiwan people , being the only hope for taiwan .
and the best way to meet that basic goal is to act in line with the basic policy of " peaceful reunification under one country , two systems , " through pragmatism , equal consultation , and putting aside differences to seek common ground , to find ways to resolve our differences .
in the last five years , while the separatist forces in taiwan have expanded and " taiwan independence " has become rampant , mainland china distinguishes the taiwan authorities from the taiwan people , distinguishing the separatist forces and " taiwan independence " from the taiwan people .
meanwhile , he said clearly that , " both during the reunification process and after reunification , we will fully respect the aspirations of the taiwan people to be the masters of their own affairs and their calls for the development of political democracy , to preserve and defend the vital interests of our taiwan compatriots . "
the history of the development of cross - strait relations shows that the taiwan people are one of the most important forces for opposing separatism , fighting " taiwan independence , " and promoting the development of cross - strait relations .
in our bid to settle the taiwan issue and bring true a peaceful unification in line with the principle of " one country , two systems , " we can adopt a more flexible approach than that towards hong kong and macao . "
the principle of " peaceful reunification , one country two systems " was first designed for the settlement of the taiwan issue .
the taiwan issue has its own specific characteristics that are different from those of the hong kong issue .
whereas the hong kong issue was a historical issue left over by colonial aggression , the taiwan issue is an issue left over by china 's civil war and is totally an internal affair of china .
therefore , during the process of implementing the principle of " one country , two systems , " there surely exist differences between hong kong , macao , and taiwan ; and concrete policies should also give expression to the different specific characteristics of the three .
vice premier qian qichen also pointed out in beijing the other day : during the process of settling the taiwan issue , we ought to introduce more flexible policies than those designed for hong kong and macao .
facts over the past 20 years have proved that the factor of the mainland motherland is a strong and positive factor in the economic exchange across the strait , and in the economic growth of hong kong and macao .
all people of insight in taiwan should make serious reflections on this issue , seize this historical opportunity , and make a wise choice .
the two sides of the taiwan strait has been separated from each other for more than half a century , yet one should understand that the happy reunion and reunification of the chinese nation is an inexorable trend of history .
the taiwan authorities should value the interests of both taiwan compatriots and the chinese nation above everything else , return to the principled stand of " one china , " engage themselves in a political talk on ending the hostile status quo across the strait , and ultimately bring true a peaceful reunification across the taiwan strait .
the report said that a us company was cloning a sheep for a billionaire , who was willing to pay $ 2.3 million .
no one has the right to interfere in the cats or dogs raised by the rich .
the question is that living conditions of the poor people , who account for 21 percent of the world 's population , are deteriorating . they even have difficulty surviving . this does accord with the basic principles of the un human rights declaration .
the bangkok declaration and program of action adopted at the meeting reflected the strong voice of the developing nations .
the bangkok declaration emphasized the necessity of establishing a fair and regular " multilateral trade system " and operating in a nondiscriminating and transparent way , which would be conducive to all the countries , the developing ones in particular .
as the un trade development council has no right to draft international rules and regulations , the developing nations have urged at the meeting the world bank , the imf organization , and the wto to introduce reforms .
first , all the member nations should participate in amending the outdated , unfair , and irrational international rules and regulations , and jointly draft new international rules and regulations .
the number of the most underdeveloped nations increased from 25 in the 1970 's to 48 . the population of these countries account for 13 percent of the world 's total , but the volume of their exports account for only 0.4 percent , a reduction of 40 percent in 10 years .
the current international rules and regulations mainly safeguard the interests of the developed nations but hinder the economic growth of the developing nations . the most underdeveloped nations have come to the edge of a precipice and it is time to put an end to such a state of affairs .
several thousand representatives from more than 100 countries had attended the previous un trade development council meetings , which spent a huge amount of funds .
as to the meaning of deflation , academia differs considerably , certainly not agreeing .
we hold that , as to the current operating state of the chinese national economy , there is no need to over - debate the meaning of deflation , because these three versions have a common economic focus , or that china 's overall prices have been in a sustained falling trend for over two years since october 1997 .
as to this trend , we should neither treat it lightly or overestimate it .
it is mild .
china 's overall prices have been falling for just a little over two years , for a drop of around 2 - 3 percent .
it is of a certain corrective nature .
historically , while sustained overall price declines have been often accompanied by economic recession or depression , there are also cases in which they have been accompanied by sustained economic growth .
it is also affected by international prices .
so while the financial authorities would subjectively like to ease the monetary credit supply somewhat , such as finding ways to lend more , due to a lack of willingness by borrowers , they can hardly do so .
since china 's current deflationary trend is due to both overall supply and overall demand , we need to analyze it .
we will speak of overall demand first .
overseas demand is export demand .
domestic demand includes investment demand and consumer demand .
in recent years , due to a number of causes , these two domestic demands have both been short .
since enterprises have gained a somewhat stronger self - restraint awareness through reform but still can hardly overcome their historic debt burden , faced with a soft market and difficulty in finding good projects , their investment decision - making tends to be cautious , for a " cautious borrowing " tendency .
and since banks have gained a higher security mentality through reform , placing more emphasis on lending quality , they are subject to a " grudging lending " tendency .
since commercial bank lending was eased somewhat , a considerable amount of credit capital has become arbitrage or hedge funds , divorced from the real industrial sector .
all of this hinders indirect bank - enterprise financing .
to keep the economy growing fast , a definitely high accumulation rate is essential .
in recent years , since economic prospects have declined due to structural reorganization , with more layoffs , the increase in individual immediate income and expected income has slowed somewhat .
consumer demand by the high - income group is basically saturated , while the masses of low - income individuals lack purchasing power , which tends to weaken the average consumer demand of our whole society .
oversupply refers to the excess industrial output capacity and product mix formed by years of blind investment and duplicate construction , as well as a staged surplus of farm products due to successive bumper harvests .
hard supply refers to the low - level surplus production capacity , inefficient supply , and structural distortion formed by years of an extensive growth form . since our market lacks elimination - through - competition forces , with enterprises lacking innovative skills , this hard supply is not corrected promptly and effectively .
since such hard supply limits both the guiding role of demand on supply and the supply space to create demand per se , keeping supply and demand interaction from forming a good cycle and structural upgrading , it exacerbates the imbalance of gross supply and demand in our society , to promote a sustained decline in overall prices .
in short , as practice develops , our policy is being steadily improved , with the steps growing constantly stronger .
particularly since the last half of 1999 , the bright spots in china 's economic operations have increased , with the overall price decline trend also tending to be eased .
the central economic work conference held in november 1999 proposed a series of policy steps to promote economic development such as continuing to pursue an active fiscal policy and bringing into better play the role of monetary policy , making decisions such as expanding domestic demand , sharply adjusting the economic structure , and promoting industrial optimization and upgrading .
i would note that , to control the deflation trend , by either expanding demand or improving supply , it will not do to rely solely on regulation and control through macroeconomic policy , because they [ supply and demand ] are also limited by our current system .
as all know , the impact of economic reform in promoting economic development often needs a process to be shown .
and some reform steps , as to their short - term impact in expanding demand and improving supply , not only cannot play an influential role , rather having a temporarily restraining effect .
while such reform steps are particularly essential and imperative , in all future reform steps , we need to do all possible to put them into effect at the right time , for a well - planned reform rhythm .
meanwhile , we need to intensify our macroeconomic expansionary policy steps , to make up for the temporarily deflationary or tightening effect of certain essential reform steps on supply and demand relations . and we also need to provide the masses with suitable monetary compensation for their temporarily lower income and higher spending due to certain essential reform steps .
international experience proves that using an expansionary macroeconomic policy to curb deflation and start up the economy needs adequate intensity and time . otherwise , it could cause a poor policy effect , forcing a restart , with such a stop - and - go method delaying the economic adjustment process , to possibly damage economic growth .
after the two sides signed the agreement , shi guangsheng said : china and india are important developing countries in the world and also great neighbors .
india will work in cooperation with china to promote the growth of world trade and for the interests of the developing nations around the world .
incomplete statistics showed that in the first 10 months of 1999 , the government purchase funds across the country had totaled some 7.5 billion yuan with the average saving rate standing at 13.5 percent and some 1 billion yuan saved .
the state - owned enterprise (soe) reform , without doubt , will be the top economic subject at the " two sessions " this year .
of all industries , the most prominent is the textile industry , which has ended the loss - inflicted situation that lasted as long as six years . the economic returns of other industries have been noticeably enhanced too .
among the 6,599 large and medium industrial enterprises that suffered losses at the end of 1997 , which were either state - owned or controlled by soes , a total of 3,100 enterprises no longer suffered losses .
according to an analyst , the enhancement of soe 's ability in international competition as quickly as possible is the principal direction of the future soe reform and development .
in order to meet with and participate in international competition in a positive attitude , china will concentrate greater efforts on setting up important and crucial sectors to prop up a number of large enterprises and groups with tremendous strength to accelerate their development speed .
the fierce competition for qualified personnel , which will be triggered by china 's wto entry , has become another hot spot in reform for which people are universally concerned .
the wto specialists who are familiar with the national conditions , possess rich professional knowledge , and have a relatively high foreign language standard will become the key objects for training by the state and enterprises .
it is generally acknowledged that qualified personnel most needed by the soes are the operators and managers who fit in with the needs of the market economy . if the situation of deficiency in incentive mechanism is not changed as quickly as possible , qualified personnel will inevitably drain away in vast numbers .
therefore , enabling the soe managers to walk out from the personnel management structure as well as setting up a qualified personnel database and entrepreneur rating system will be one of the significant moves of the soe reform in future .
zhu bangzao made these comments in connection with recent statements by japan and some other g-8 members expressing their willingness to invite china to attend the g-8 summit as an observer or even to join the group .
he said : the group of seven was originally an organization whereby major developed countries coordinated their economic policies and other issues . it was later known as the group of eight after russia joined some of its activities .
china 's stands and views on asian - pacific affairs and other major international issues are known to all .
the chinese side also wants to stress that the important role played by the united nations and its security council in international affairs cannot be replaced .
this is a common understanding of the international community at large .
the circular demands : all financial institutions must organize management personnel and business transactors at various levels to earnestly study relevant policies as well as laws and regulations to firmly establish a consciousness of operating in accordance with laws and regulations .
they must establish a consciousness of cost and benefit and integrate the active organization of deposits with the improvement of the quality of assets as well as business results to comprehensively raise the standard of management .
at the same time , they must give full play to the role of industry self - disciplinary organizations of financial institutions at various localities in mutual supervision .
president jiang zemin met yildirim akbulnut , speaker of the grand national assembly of turkey , and his party here this afternoon .
the two sides conducted talks in a cordial and friendly atmosphere .
jiang zemin extended welcome to akbulnut on his visit to china .
over the past 30 years ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries , the two sides have conducted cooperation in the political , economic , and cultural fields that have yielded fruitful results ; and the mutual relations between our two countries have undergone a considerable growth .
in recent years , there have been frequent mutual exchanges between the top leadership of the two countries , which have given a powerful impetus to a sustained growth in the friendly relations of cooperation between china and turkey .
jiang zemin pointed out : stretching over eurasia , turkey is a country which has a vital importance to all regions in the world .
the chinese government has attached great importance to promoting its friendly relations of cooperation with turkey .
strengthening sino - turkish relations not only conforms to the fundamental interests of our two countries and two peoples , but is also beneficial to maintaining regional peace and stability .
akbulnut thanked jiang zemin for finding time to meet him in the midst of pressing affairs .
he also conveyed president demirel 's cordial greetings to president jiang zemin , and expressed hope that president jiang zemin can pay a visit to turkey in the future .
the achievements already attained by the chinese people have won the admiration of the world .
he stressed : turkey has all along pursued a one - china policy , and highly respects china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
turkey is opposed to any interference in the internal affairs of other countries .
beijing , 22 feb (zxs) - - chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao said here today : the chinese side is deeply worried about the recent tension in kosovo .
at the foreign ministry 's news briefing today , zhu bangzao said : the kosovo issue is a very complicated ethnic and religious problem rooted in a region of yugoslavia .
the spokesman pointed out : the recent situation in kosovo has once again shown that , since the un peacekeeping troops and civilian organizations established their presence in kosovo , the un security council 's resolution 1244 has not been carried out earnestly and effectively , and kosovo 's security situation has not improved noticeably .
he said : china 's position on the kosovo issue is very clear .
he said : china and the united states bear special responsibility for global and regional peace , stability , and security . the us side should act prudently [ shen zhong xing shi 1957 6850 5887 0057 ] when it comes to implementing the national missile defense [ nmd ] plan and approaching the taiwan issue .
the spokesman pointed out : the issue of ballistic missile defenses was one of the central topics of the consultations .
this plan is not conducive to the global strategic balance and stability , nor is it conducive to regional peace and security . in addition to damaging the legitimate security interests of other countries , it will eventually work against the united states .
for this reason , the chinese side hopes that the us side will give more consideration to the political and strategic prices it will have to pay for the nmd plan , and to refrain from testing or deploying the plan , which will undermine stability and harm other countries and the united states itself .
zhu bangzao said : sino - us relations are now faced with opportunities for further improvement and development ; there are also challenges .
he said that china is willing to join hands with the us side in advancing sino - us relations in the direction defined by the presidents of the two countries and toward the goal established by them .
the us side said : the clinton administration is committed to developing us - china relations .
beijing , 22 february (zxs) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao pointed out here today : the so - called " matter of the infra - red camera " is a sheer rumor . he made necessary elaboration on the report 's details .
zhu bangzao solemnly pointed out : the report was groundless .
the spokesman said : the chinese company has provided its american counterpart with written explanations on the end - users and purposes of the device .
in order to further alert himself and educate other people , wang shaohong borrowed a video recorder and bought videotapes to record eight tapes of programs shown on tv about ferreting out the true cult nature of falun gong .
wang shaohong also wrote a large number of materials on ferreting out falun gong in which he deeply unmasked li hongzhi 's lies that falun gong has no organization and has " loose management , " as well as his evil motives of " conveying law " among the cadres and masses .
lan fu , former vice mayor of xiamen and one of the key figures in a big smuggling case involving 80 billion yuan , fled to australia . he recently was arrested by mainland authorities in hong kong , however .
according to well - informed sources , as lan fu led a hard life in australia , he called xiaman city cpc secretary hong yongshi , asking hong to allow him to work in the xiamen office in hong kong through a " back - door deal . "
all major suspects related to the yuanhua smuggling case have been arrested .
under such circumstances , lan fu was compelled to call xiamen city cpc secretary hong yongshi in an attempt to make a deal with him . lan requested that he be transferred to work in the xiamen office in hong kong provided no judicial investigation was conducted into his case .
it has been learned that upon lan 's arrival at the xiamen office , he first contacted hong yongshi . according to hong 's instructions issued during the telephone conversation , lan did not contact anyone . he directly went to a certain designated house .
after arriving in xiamen , he again was sent to beijing by plane for investigation .
it also has been learned that on his way back to xiamen under escort , lan fu realized that he had failed to attain his hope .
then jiang listened to an account of work given by shenzhen officials .
beijing is now hotly probing and fiercely handling the smuggling shielding case of li jizhu , former vice minister of public security .
following the central commission for discipline inspection 's deployment of massive forces to investigate the xiamen yuanhua smuggling case , the commission now has urged guangdong to investigate and handle the smuggling case involving li jizhou .
guangdong 's efforts to investigate and handle the li jizhou case has achieved some results , and found the case involving several cities such as shenzhen , guangzhou , and qingyuan .
reportedly , when li jizhou , former vice minister of public security , took the post ( temporarily and concurrently ) of deputy director of the guangdong public security bureau , he made the acquaintance of a car dealer . li jizhou took advantage of his power and shielded the businessman 's smuggling .
the businessman was arrested at the end of last year and admitted that responsible officials from shenzhen and guangzhou customs were involved .
he was suspected of being involved in smuggling more than 1,700 cars , and the money involved reached more than 100 million yuan . xiao shimu has been arrested . the predecessor of xiao shimu named zhou has also been arrested for involvement in smuggling .
second , now hong kong and macao have all been smoothly returned to china and both sides of the taiwan strait will join wto .
the former has proven by reality that the reunification of china according to the principle of " one country with two systems " is totally feasible .
although the taiwan issue is different from the situation of hong kong and macao , but the difference must never be used as a pretext to reject peaceful reunification .
if taiwan , hong kong , macao and the mainland of the motherland are combined and cooperation among all regions is strengthened , we are convinced it will be beneficial to economic development in all places .
third , reform and opening up on the mainland of the motherland are being deepened and expanded .
china will formulate the " tenth five - year plan , " promote a plan of " great development in the western region , " and accelerate the three major reforms including the reform of state - owned enterprises .
one china is the core content of the white paper .
whether taiwan and the mainland belong to " one state " or " two states " is not a general question . instead , it is a question of principle and the cardinal issue of right and wrong .
however , people all know that the " state " and the " government " representing the state are two different things .
now the taiwan authorities ' so - called " republic of china " is in fact nothing but a historical issue left from the civil war between the kuomintang [ kmt ] and cpc . it is illegitimate according to either domestic or international law and it fundamentally has no right to represent china .
this is even more absurd and ridiculous . did the kmt regime in taiwan ever govern taiwan before recovering taiwan from japan ?
why ?
the reason is quite simple . state sovereignty can only be exercised by the government representing the country . when the old government was overthrown , naturally only the new government could replace the old government to exercise sovereign rights .
being afraid to face reality , resorting to sophistry in self - justification , distorting the truth and deceiving the people are the most miserable things done by taiwan 's ruling authorities .
meanwhile , there are plenty of such things as " taiwan first , " " giving priority to taiwan , " and " a community of life in taiwan . "
all people in taiwan are chinese . the difference is only who went there earlier and who went there later . there is no difference between taiwanese and chinese .
all these can only be done by adhering to and protecting the principle of one china .
therefore , whether those people can adhere to and protect the principle of on china or not divides those who truly love taiwan and those who falsely love taiwan .
nevertheless , judging from policies of principal candidates in the upcoming taiwan 's general election on mainland affairs , lee teng - hui 's [ li teng - hui 's ] " two states theory " still influences many people and cross - strait relations are still full of hidden worries .
for instance , some candidates are still defending lee teng - hui 's " two states theory , " saying it is a " practical and self - determined position . " some people consider relations between the two sides of the strait as " quasi - international relations on the basis of relative sovereignty . "
the kmt 's " two state theory " and dpp 's " taiwan independence argument " are getting closer .
the " separatist theory " advocated by them is definitely not " loving taiwan " but " bringing ruin " to taiwan . "
we can only place our hopes of taiwan 's future and the reunification of the motherland on people in taiwan who have the honorable tradition of patriotism .
fengnan city is a county - level city under the jurisdiction of tangshan city , hebei province .
since the drive of reform and opening up to the outside world was launched , fengnan city has scored remarkable achievements in economic construction and social development .
accompanied by ye liansong , secretary of the hebei provincial cpc committee and governor niu maosheng , zhu rongji listened to the reports of the fengnan city cpc committee and city government on party building and the preparatory work of " three stresses " education the morning of 22 february and discussed the issue with them .

guangzhou , 23 feb ( xinhua ) - - zhang changli , chairman and president of huali industrial company limited in shunde city , guangdong province , colluded with a bank official to illegally gather capital amounting to 13.5 billion yuan by offering high interest rates .
recently , the shunde city people 's court in guangdong province sentenced zhang changli to 10 years in prison and ordered him to pay a fine of 200,000 yuan on charges of illegally soliciting funds from the public .
in march 1998 , public security organs , through interpol , asked police in new zealand , cuba , tonga , thailand , and malaysia to assist in tracking down zhang changli .
with the help of the police in a southeast asian country , chinese public security organs arrested and extradited zhang changli back to china in may 1999 .
after finishing the paperwork , huali industrial company limited paid the depositors either the high - interest portions or all interest in advance . when their deposits reach maturity dates , depositors might go to the beijiao office to withdraw their principal or remaining interest with their passbooks .
he yingzhi instructed relevant personnel at the beijiao office to transfer 316 depositors ' current deposits , amounting to 1.3 billion yuan , to huali industrial company limited , in violation of the financial administration system and by means of non - passbook account transfers .
zhang changli 's case of illegally soliciting deposits from the public was an economic crime that severely violated the state financial administration system and disrupted the financial order , incurring enormous losses of state , collective , and personal property .
according to statistics prepared by the chinese customs , the volume of china 's exports with the united states this january hit $ 3.42 billion , up 38.7 percent over the same period last year .
among china 's imports from the united states , the value of processing trade products reached $ 5.3 billion , 27 percent of the gross value of imports from the united states .
the value of general trade imports came to $ 10.3 billion , up 34.1 percent , and accounting for 52.7 percent of the total value of imports from the united states thus putting an end to the downward glide that has been going on for three years running .
analysis shows that the value of china 's favorable balance of processing trade with the united states amounted to $ 24.52 billion , which constitutes the main source of china 's foreign trade surplus .
zheng yunmei , deputy director of information bureau of the general office of the npc [ national people 's congress ] standing committee , told this reporter that the website " china npc news " introduced last october has been visited by a large number of people .
during their " two sessions , " their websites were visited tens of thousands times a day .
during the " two sessions , " quite a few e - mail messages received replies from the municipal people 's congress deputies and cppcc committee members and some problems were also resolved with the help or under the supervision of the deputies and members .
a beijing citizen had complained about a restaurant downstairs , saying that it was noisy and its oil smoke had harassed the residents to a serious extent .
shortly afterwards , it was learned from the departments concerned that the restaurant , which had harassed the residents , had stopped its business for rectification .
the party central committee also decided to appoint comrades chen yujie ( female ) , xie xuren , and wang chengming as deputy secretaries of its financial work committee .
since the initiation of the reform and opening - up program , especially since the party central committee and the state council held the national financial work conference in 1997 , china has made notable achievements in the development of the financial work and the reform of the financial system .
the recent exchanges and reshuffles of the major leading cadres of some financial institutions were decided by the party central committee and the state council after giving prudent consideration to all factors to meet the needs of work and comply with the characteristics and reality of financial institutions .
their method will help further develop the financial work , strengthen the leading bodies of financial institutions , train and bring up leading cadres , and make leading bodies younger in average age .
in recent years , henan province has made remarkable achievements in using their own advantages and readjusting its agricultural structure .
this is an important aspect of the readjustment of the country 's agricultural structure , and , more importantly , it is the main direction of structural readjustment in the major grain - and cotton - producing areas .
second , it is necessary to shift from the simplistic grain and cotton production to the simultaneous development of a diversified economy .
third , it is necessary to shift from extensive to intensive farming .
while giving full play to the production scale of major grain - and cotton - producing areas , we should pay close attention to quality , cut the cost , improve the efficiency , and increase our market competitiveness .
the state should give the necessary support , step up the construction of infrastructure facilities and the ecological environment , improve the conditions for agricultural production , promote agricultural scientific and technological advances , and actively and steadily promote structural readjustment in the major grain - and cotton - producing areas .
agricultural departments at various levels should increase technical guidance , step up the popularization of new technologies , carry out various supportive measures , and regulate the supply of good - quality , special seeds . 2 .
it is necessary to effectively strengthen wheat - field management .
agricultural technicians should be organized to check up on the growth of cereal crop seedlings , the soil moisture content , and plant diseases and insects in the field and to guide peasants in spring field management . 3 .
it is necessary to ensure the supply of materials for spring plowing and sowing .
credit cooperatives should take the initiative in providing credit for spring plowing and sowing .
accompanying wen jiabao on the inspection tour were ma kai , wan baorui , han changfu , wang mingyi , and other responsible officials of relevant departments .
this is the common understanding expressed by military and non - military experts at a discussion meeting held today in beijing .
meeting participants generally felt that the release of the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " is very essential and timely .
against such a backdrop , it is very essential for the chinese government to release the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue . "
on the issue related to the principle of the motherland 's reunification , we resolutely cannot compromise and make a concession .
the meeting participants also pointed out that the release of the white paper is a timely warning to taiwan 's separatist forces .
meanwhile , it has allowed the international community to have a better understanding of the chinese government 's stand on upholding the one - china principle and achieving peaceful reunification , and further recognize the error and harm of lee teng - hui 's [ li denghui 's ] " two - state theory . "
the release of the white paper is conducive to defending the interest of the country and people ; peaceful settlement of the taiwan issue ; and prompting the international community to understand and handle relevant issues on the one - china principle .
some of the military experts participating in the meeting said : after the release of the white paper , as soldiers , we feel that the responsibility shouldered by the people 's army is extremely heavy .
we must watch closely the development of the taiwan situations and make our contributions toward safeguarding the reunification of the motherland .
( 1 ) in the summer of 1997 , a strange phenomenon emerged time and again in the beijiao office of the shunde city branch of the people 's construction bank of china in guangdong : the customers could not withdraw cash from their savings passbook at the bank .
realizing the seriousness of the problem , the responsible person of the shunde city branch of people 's construction bank of china reported the case to the public security organs at once .
by the time the case was exposed , the company had failed to repay deposits totaling some 6.9 billion yuan .
being aware of his serious crime , zhang changli , director and concurrently general manager of huali enterprise company ltd. and also the prime suspect of the case of illegally absorbing deposits in public , immediately and secretly fled the country , carrying with him some funds .
by the end of april 1999 , the public security organs had already found clues and learned that zhang changli had moved about in southeast asia with a forged western samoan passport .
( 2 ) zhang changli had risen as leader of an enterprise run by the people during the big tide of market economy .
where could he raise such a huge amount of funds within a short period of time ?
within a short space of two - odd years , the units and individuals from anhui , jiangxi , shaanxi , hubei , hainan , guangdong , and some other provinces gradually deposited funds into their savings accounts at the beijiao office of people 's construction bank of china .
in handling the " deposits , " huali enterprise company ltd. paid part of the higher interest to the customers in advance , promising to repay both the principal and the remaining interest to the customers who produce the deposit passbook to the bank on the agreed date .
by september 1997 when the case was exposed , huali enterprise company ltd. had illegally raised as much as some 13.5 billion yuan in this way .
however , due to blind investment , zhang changli failed to achieve the expected high yields with the huge amount of funds he had raised with the result that huali enterprise company ltd. ran into financial difficulties .
as of july or august 1997 , huali enterprise company ltd. could no longer repay the due deposits to the customers and some customers time and again demanded repayment of their money from both the bank and the company and even reported the case to the departments in charge .
finally , the plot came to light .
( 3 ) as the violators of law shall be punished , zhang changli has been punished in accordance with the law in the end .
moreover , the process of illegally absorbing deposits in public also very often gives rise to other economic crimes .
originally , some enterprises or financial departments hope to rapidly coordinate funds . however , such a highly risky and illegal practice is bound to open a huge loophole in capital without exception sooner or later and a snowballing effect is likely to aggravate the malpractice further .
in order to block up a loophole , some people are bound to be tempted to commit bribery , graft , or swindle or engage in more serious criminal activities .
the state shall protect the legitimate income of individual citizens or units only and shall choose legitimate savings methods or other legitimate investment methods only .
the reason is that zhang changli had taken full advantage of a small number of people 's psychological desire for higher interest . besides , seeing zhang shielded by the staff of certain financial organs , some people were willing take a chance even though they were aware that the method had violated the law .
zhang changli 's case of illegally absorbing deposits in public has again sounded a warning to the public : do n't rashly believe in certain people 's promise of higher interest . more importantly , people should see through the illegal activities conducted by certain individuals under the signboard of the state .
the net of justice is wide but not loose .
statistics showed that in 1999 public security organs across the country seized a total of more than 110,000 economic criminals and captured more than 20 suspects of economic crimes from nine foreign countries or overseas regions .
zhang changli 's case has once again shown that no matter how cunning they are or no matter which end of the earth they flee to , economic criminals will still be unable to escape the just trial by the people and the stern punishment by the law in the end .
liu fangren believed : the key factors restricting the development of guizhou are poor transport facilities and inadequate information .
take the four - d - class [ as printed ] guiyang airport , which went into operation two years ago , for example , the number of passengers carried increased from 700,000 to 800,000 in 1997 to 1.31 million in 1999 . the airport has played an important role in opening guizhou wider to the outside world .
during the ninth five - year plan period , guiyang has been a major site for railway construction in the southwest region , and the state had invested more than 30 billion yuan in this regard in guizhou , accounting for 44 percent of the state 's total investment in railway construction in the southwestern region .
the zhuzhou - liupanshui , neijiang - kunming , and shuicheng - baiguo railways and the two major marshaling yards at guiyang and liupanshui have been started at the same time , and a massive force of railways builders are fighting a great battle in guizhou 's lofty ridges and towering mountains .
by 2002 guizhou will become the province with the highest railway density in the western region .
the guizhou plateau is the watershed between the two major river systems of chang jiang and zhu jiang .
strengthening the protection of ecological environment and controlling soil erosion are an important task in implementing guizhou 's strategy for sustainable development , which also has a bearing on the overall situation in " lasting stability " in the vast lower reaches of chang jiang and zhu jiang .
liu fangren stressed : guizhou will resolutely implement the important policy decision of the party central committee and the state council concerning a natural - forest protection project , and it will start first in areas along the lines of communication and in places for sightseeing and scenic resorts with better conditions .
at present , stress is to be laid on returning the reclaimed sloping land above 35 degrees to what it was .
the reason why anti - corruption is still one of the major issues of the two plenary sessions of the npc and cppcc this year is because it is often discussed but remains a new topic and because it cannot be accomplished only at one stroke .
premier zhu rongji pointed out at the meeting that our government is the people 's government and being honest and incorruptible is the basic requirement .
taking a broad view of the work of anti - corruption in 1999 , we may say that considerable results have been achieved .
the work of setting up a visible construction market was further carried forward . visible construction markets were set up at all cities at region level and above except 14 that were approved not to be built , which effectively controlled corrupt dealings in building projects .
positive results were achieved in carrying forward the government purchasing system , account appointment system , audit system of economic responsibility of leading cadres during their tenures , as well as the system of open village work , open factory work , and open government work .
one should admit that the chinese government made great efforts and did a solid job in every step of fighting corruption in the past whole year , however , it 's impossible to accomplish the whole task at one stroke as the burden of anti - corruption is heavy and the road is still long .
after hearing a lecture on network techniques given by relevant experts , zhang wannian delivered a speech . he pointed out : with the development of information and computer technologies , network techniques have developed very rapidly and permeated all fields of people 's life , yielding a comprehensive and profound impact .
zhang wannian said : under the new situation , chairman jiang is paying the greatest attention to two historic problems - - namely , to win in a future high - tech war that might happen , and to maintain the people 's army 's character , true qualities and work style .
to do a good job in arming ourselves with scientific theories is the ideological basis and important guarantee for " being immune to degeneration . "
zhang wannian emphasized : to do a good job in arming the pla with high - tech knowledge is a pressing need and important guarantee for " winning in war . "
all pla units must study to acquire high - tech knowledge and enhance their capability to win in a high - tech war .
the leading cadres at all levels in the pla must study to gain high - tech knowledge and enhance their ability of commanding and winning in a high - tech war .
in learning high - tech knowledge , the central military commission and all pla general departments should take the lead in creating a common practice and persist in study to spur on all pla units .
ding guangen , member of the political bureau and member of the secretariat of the cpc central committee and chairman of the central commission for guiding the spiritual civilization building , presided over and spoke at the meeting .
it is important to launch more activities which suit the needs of the masses and are well - received by the masses . cities should lay stress on the work of their communities ; rural areas , on the work of their villages and towns ; and industries and trades , on the work of their showcase units .
we should devote greater efforts to propagating and spreading good experiences gained in the ideological and political work at the grassroots level ; and let the masses feel personally , through the things and people around them , that the ideological and political work is being reinforced in real terms .
we should show respect , understanding , and care for people ; be good at starting our work by attending the issues that the masses are most concerned , as well as the issues that are most closely related to the immediate interests of the masses ; and complete our work to the full satisfaction of the masses .
we should reinforce the ideological work among young students , create a sound atmosphere for a healthy mental and physical growth of teenagers and youths , help them establish correct ideals and convictions , and reinforce their concept of observing discipline and the law .
communist party members must set an example for the entire society to follow , while leading cadres are required to play an exemplary role for the whole party .
ding guangen stressed that we should reinforce our awareness of seizing positions , vigorously propagate the main theme of our time , go all out to develop the healthy tendencies in society , and give a wide publicity to advanced models and work experiences in the ideological and political field .
we should organize the writing of a number of articles which carry a lot of weight and show depth of thought , so as to provide the masses with clearly aimed and persuasive answers to the questions that they are most concerned .
members of the central commission for guiding the spiritual civilization building attended today 's meeting .
special article by zts reporter lin ying ( 2651 7751 ) : " prc will usher in another wave of foreign investment a chinese expert recently forecast that china will usher in a new wave of foreign investment after its accession to the wto this year .
last year , foreign capital actually used still maintained a considerable scale , reaching $ 40.39 billion , making the prc second only to the united states in the world in absorbing foreign investment for six years in a row .
the statistics demonstrates that last year alone , the total import and export amount of the foreign - invested enterprises reached 174.5 billion , increasing by 10.7 percent over the previous year , and accounting for 48.8 percent of the total import and export amount of the entire country .
2 ) about 70 percent of the foreign capital used by china came from the asian region and , after the financial storm , the storm - afflicted asian countries further opened their markets and readjusted their economic structures , which has produced a certain negative impact on china 's absorption of foreign capital .
4 ) the slowdown of china 's domestic demand and the comparatively rapid wage increase in the coastal developed areas have , to a certain extent , crippled the power of the china market to attract foreign capital .
nevertheless , the expert pointed out that the emergence of economic recovery in various asian countries and regions such as hong kong , rok , japan , and southeast asian countries would once again contribute to an increase of investment in china in 2000 .
along with its accession to the wto , china will open more domains to the outside world .
this new round of opening - up moves will provide new opportunities for foreign investors , thereby setting off another wave of foreign investment in china .
beijing , 23 feb ( xinhua ) - - on a certain day in january 2000 , fleets of new submarines were sailing across the roaring surface of the bohai sea .
not long ago , the general staff department circulated a notice of commendation on their advanced deeds .
at 1000 , the officers and men of a certain submarine were steering the iron long whale slowly into the military port after fighting with the stormy sea for dozens of days and nights .
have not seen you for a long while , motherland !
this submarine is a piece of new main - battle equipment developed by our country .
in order to test its performance and underwater strike capability and test the combat strength and survival capability of officers and men , this submarine , with the central military commission 's authorization , carried out the special task of an " underwater long march . "
" the success of this long voyage will become an important symbol of the people 's navy 's modernization drive . "
prior to setting sail , vice admiral shi yunsheng , commander of the navy , issued a marching order to the officers and men going on the long voyage .
for months , the officers and men - fighting with the stormy waves , keeping away from hidden reefs and crossing island chains deep down the ocean - had been exploring the way in unfamiliar waters , venturing into " deadly sea areas , " and struggling with pacific storms .
this is a test of the ultimate limit of the submarine , the crew , and the weapons .
but as a commander , he was more preoccupied with the thoughts that his unit should take advantage of the long voyage to undergo rigorous training close to actual combat .
at the mobilization meeting , liu guangyou said in a resounding voice : " if we stay one more minute under the sea , we will be a bit more certain of winning a naval war .
" put the helm fully to port , twin screws up by two ! "
the submarine sailed deep down in the ocean again .
the higher authorities ordered the submarine to launch a torpedo attack on an " enemy " frigate .
the sun quietly rose above the horizon , and the submarine was slowly rising to the surface .
on the quay , welcoming bunting fluttered in the breeze and the celebrating sound of gongs and drums resounded through the sea and the sky .
with chest and head high , the officers and men stepped down from the submarine in proper order .
over the past 20 years , this submarine unit has successively organized dozens of oceangoing voyages , with all of its submarines having gone through the test of pacific storms , and set dozens of records in the building history of submarine units of the people 's navy .
in june 1999 , a professor from the naval submarine academy specially came to a certain submarine to ask noncommissioned officer [ nco ] wang changlai about the operating procedure of a certain new type of torpedo and invite him to compile together teaching material for using the torpedo .
wang changlai , 42 , is the most senior submarine nco of the navy .
over the past 20 - plus years , he , through assiduous self - study , has mastered the professional skills of firing four models of submarine torpedoes and become a " soldier professor " of high - tech equipment .
sonar is the " ear " of a submarine .
after becoming a sonar soldier , chou yuping is well aware of his heavy responsibility .
a year later , he became very skillful in " determining what it is just by listening " .
chou yuping has also compiled a two - volume " sonar operation manual " and published three academic theses .
in 1999 alone , the unit made over 160 scientific and technological innovations .
submarine torpedo nco zheng wenfa boldly suggested the research and development of a set of new equipment for simulated submarine torpedo attack training .
a year later , when zheng wenfa connected his newly - developed simulator with the torpedo attack director , they were incompatible .
he did not flinch from the failure .
he successively went to science research institutes in beijing and then shanghai to ask experts for advice and gather information , made 30 - plus major changes in the design plan , and eventually solved the difficult problem of compatibility between the simulator and the director .
on 9 october 1998 , 30 - odd experts and professors at home were in beijing to hold , for the first time ever , a high - level scientific and technological achievement authentication meeting for a submarine soldier .
soon afterwards , the navy formally reported this achievement to higher authorities as winner of the army 's science and technology progress class two award .
the south china sea , stormy sea and rapid waves .
following a several thousands nautical miles long - range raid , a new - model submarine led by unit chief liu guangyou , came here to take part in a real - strength drill on an unprecedented scale .
on the evening when the exercise was over , the moon cast its bright reflection in the water .
at that moment , it was pressure that liu guangyou , who had gone to military academies four times for further studies and taken submarines to oceangoing voyages for a dozen times , felt the strongest .
in january 1999 , the unit 's party committee held three enlarged meetings to promote science and technology training .
at the meetings , liu guangyou unequivocally noted : " method of operation is the key to fighting for the battlefield initiative .
" torpedo attack has three great risks , how to tackle that ? "
you just go ahead boldly , we will hold ourselves responsible if there is anything wrong ! "
on this basis , they organized officers and men to carry out simulated training more than 100 times .
with the suddenness of a thunderbolt , two of our submarines launched a preemptive attack on the " enemy . "
according to this plan , the mine - laying depth would be several times greater than normal .
in july , hot summertime - - members of the standing committee of the detachment [ zhi dui 2388 7130 ] , including unit chief liu guangyou and political commissar huang yaonian , repeatedly went to the submarine despite the high temperature to find an answer together with the officers and men .
unit leaders and grass - roots officers and men gradually came to a common understanding , and drills on this new method of operation went on .
a new drill began .
the submarine went deep down the sea , 20 meters , 30 meters , 40 meters . . .
the new submarine 's first great - depth fully - loaded mine - laying was a complete success !
in 1999 , this underwater mighty force achieved repeated successes in drills organized for various new methods of operation , including attack , mine - laying , and anti - submarine .
all these successes indicate that the people 's navy 's submarine unit has the extraordinary capability to attack its opponents !
li dezhu called on nationalities affairs commissions at all levels to take the opportunity of the large - scale development of the western region to change their concepts , work style , and work mode , and liberate themselves from their conventional and habitual work mode .
li dezhu emphasized that in the large - scale development of the western region , it is necessary to uphold " five principles . "
hence , li chunting believes that to adapt to the requirements of wto accession , the bad must provide strong financial backing for the state in building a highly effective and secure grain and cotton reserve system .
judging by current conditions in china , a grain reserve on an initial scale has formed due to the recent bumper harvests and the implementation of the policy of open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain .
the amount of these reserves has already reached the 17 to 18 percent proportion laid down by the un food and agriculture organization .
however , since china is a large agricultural country with a big population , there is a certain gap between our current reserve capacity and regulation and control measures on the one hand and our national condition on the other .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao 22 february stated in explicit terms that china has no intention to attend the g-8 summit and its related activities .
german chancellor gerhard schroder said : " judging from a medium - range point of view , i think we should seriously consider the question of whether or not china 's joining g-8 is meaningful . "
french president jacques chirac said : " in view of the fact that china has become a main force in preserving world stability , i am personally in favor of inviting china to join g-8 and forming a group of 9 . "
therefore , china is necessary to express its own point of view .
the remarks by the chinese foreign ministry 's spokesman were quite equivocal . he emphatically pointed out the important and desirable role of the un .
china cannot accept this kind of practice .
china is one of the five permanent members of the unsc with veto power on major issues .
g-8 bypassing the unsc to act last year was in effect bypassing china and weaken china 's legitimate rights to take part and exert its influence on major international affairs .
therefore , since last year , china has actively sought measures to alter this unfavorable situation in order to protect china 's interests .
on the one side , china has made efforts to protect the legality and authority of un and to reaffirm the correct track of handling world affairs by un at an earlier date .
china 's pork and eggs respectively account for 46 and 38 percent of the world 's totals ; china is indeed a major country for animal products , but not a power .
we must therefore strive to enhance the market competitiveness of our livestock industry .
in that case , what are the new features of china 's livestock industry which is scattered into tiny pieces and which has undergone 50 years of development , especially the extraordinary development of the past 20 years , and what are the focal points in its development in the 21 st century ?
in particular , in some coastal provinces half the peasants no longer raised pigs and chickens , while there also emerged households or villages specializing in the livestock industry , with households raising 100 pigs and 1,000 chickens .
the integration and industrialization of livestock raising also led forward and spurred the regionalization of the livestock industry and its formation into large scale .
what is particularly gratifying is that the three northeast provinces , which were originally big importers of animal products , now rank among the country 's top 10 producers . meat production in jilin and liaoning respectively ranks 11 th and 12 th in the nation , and their granaries have turned into " meat stores . "
although china 's livestock industry still mainly consists of scattered operations at present , large - scale pig farms now account for 15 percent of the total number of pigs ready for slaughter ; and regions with developed animal product processing industries now account for over 30 percent of large - scale stockraising .
this policy , however , led to seriously irrational distribution of animal products between the urban and rural areas , and there were many mistakes in taking simultaneous account of the interests of the agricultural producers and those of the urban consumers .
the procurement policies for the main animal products were abolished in 1985 , and the basic role of the market in resource allocation was gradually brought into play .
the supply and marketing cooperatives have consistently taken part in handling animal products , but the biggest change after the reform compared with previously was that they changed from being purchasing agents into undertakings truly making their own decisions .
the original foreign trade and state - run and cooperative commerce undertakings mentioned above expanded from circulation to the processing of animal products and livestock and poultry production and integrated operations , in order to consolidate their position and develop and boost their strength in handling animal products .
they emerged in the years when procurement quotas were still being set for the main animal products ; they broke through the old pattern of only engaging in the livestock industry , and were the first modern enterprises to carry out integrated production and sales of animal products .
this way of doing things achieved the dovetailing of scattered production with concentrated sales markets , reduced the links in the circulation chain , lowered circulation losses , and acted as a tremendous boost to developing the livestock industry .
some which have developed relatively well have succeeded in integrating production , processing , and sales and in industrialized operations .
the switch of the livestock industry from scattered and extensive stockraising to large - scale stockraising , and from a family sideline undertaking to an intensive and modernized form is also a switch from traditional to modern economy .
as a result of the construction of several " shopping basket programs , " livestock and poultry production bases have extended from the inner to the outer outskirts of cities and into neighboring provinces , and this accords with the laws of the development of productive forces .
viewing the worldwide conditions , beef is also a big item ; in the past 10 years , centered on raising cattle through producing citrus , the state has invested a great deal of funds to support cattle raising , with the result that there has been a big increase in beef production .
compared with pork and eggs , however , it is a " little brother . "
in accordance with china 's national condition and with reference to foreign experiences , in the next 10 years , and even throughout the entire 21 st century , china 's livestock industry should focus on developing table hens and dairy products .
the government at all levels should raise table hens and the dairy industry to an important position , and give these great support as key industries . 1 .
the production cycle of table hens in short , the fodder conversion rate is high , and chicken prices are the cheapest on the international market , where consumption has registered a big increase .
for several successive years we have imported several times more chicken products than we have exported , and unless we speed up the development of raising table hens , then once we join the wto , china 's market will certainly be occupied by the main chicken - producing countries .
the main producing areas for table hens in china are the outskirts of several large cities and a few provinces and municipalities including shandong , jilin , hebei , and henan .
it appears that china 's table hen industry should attach importance to developing the big domestic market ; of course it should also make still greater efforts to win exports , because chicken production in neighboring japan is declining each year , and this is a market that we should exert great efforts to occupy . 2 .
strengthen the dairy industry , the weakest point china leads the world in several aspects of the livestock industry , but its weakest point is dairy products .
yet milk is gradually being accepted by middle - aged and older people as a replenisher of calcium , and this also comprises part of a stable consumer market .
milk and milk products can only increase year on year .
in particular , when they become adults , children who grow up clutching a milk bottle will not just drink a little in the morning , like today 's adults , but will consume 500 to 1,000 grams a day , and this is already quite common among middle and primary pupils .
developing the livestock industry is for the sake of improving living standards and improving the people 's physique ; at the same time the livestock industry solves the job problem for 80 million laborers , and is a major industry for increasing peasant incomes .
the domestic consumption market for animal products is very great .
beijing , 23 feb (zxs) - - today , this staff reporter learned from the eu representative office in china that china and the eu will continue negotiations on china 's accession to the world trade organization on 24 february .
by the time this reporter filed this dispatch at 1715 [ 0915 gmt ] today , neither side had disclosed whether the negotiations had made any progress .
beijing , 23 feb ( xinhua ) - - from 21 to 22 february , chinese assistant foreign minister wang yi and vietnamese assistant foreign minister le cong phung held the seventh round of sino - vietnamese government - level talks on border issues in beijing .
on 22 february , chinese vice foreign minister yang wenchang met le cong phung 's delegation and attended a ceremony on signing the " summary of minutes " of the seventh round of sino - vietnamese government - level talks on border issues .
vietnamese ambassador to china bui hong phuc attended the meeting and the signing ceremony .
at the start of the new year , the public security contingent building , a long - standing focus of attention of all walks of life in the society , has made a major stride forward .
the public security ministry today decided to introduce some 12 forceful , quick - yield , user - friendly , and easy - for - mass - supervision measures with an eye on bringing about a fundamental turn for the better in the face of the public security contingent through unremitting efforts over the next three years or so .
in order to grasp problems on an earlier date , we should work hard to identify and tackle problems of tendencies and symptoms of problems and exert our utmost to resolve the problems in the embryonic stage .
beijing , 23 feb - - chinese and european union [ eu ] representatives will continue talks today on china 's wto accession .
it is noteworthy that both sides have attached great importance to the negotiations .
apart from the eu , there are still 10 - odd countries that have not signed bilateral agreements with china .
in spite of this , the official remained optimistic about china 's wto accession within a year .
the publication of this white paper has evoked strong repercussions in the international community .
over the past seven years , tremendous changes have taken place in the domestic and international situation .
running through the whole white paper is a central theme , that is , the one - china principle is the basis and precondition for realizing peaceful reunification .
why is it necessary to launch the struggle against the " two states " theory ?
this is because the " two states " theory has undermined the development of cross - strait relations , as well as the basis and precondition for peaceful reunification .
thanks to the resolute struggle waged by the mainland side , the taiwan authorities could not but announce that the " two states " theory will not be " incorporated into the constitution , " nor has it been turned into a major policy keynote in the present election .
taiwan is an inalienable part of china . this is the consensus of the entire chinese people .
any attempt to separate taiwan from china will bring disasters to taiwan .
it will enable the people of taiwan to make a clear distinction between right and wrong , work for peaceful reunification , and opt for peaceful reunification rather than war .
all this reflects the chinese government 's stand to resolutely safeguard the one - china principle .
they should not talk nonsense with regard to the taiwan issue or encourage " taiwan independence , " much less should they underestimate the chinese people 's determination and capability to safeguard china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and achieve total reunification .
therefore , i think that it is impossible for two different operational mechanisms and rules to exist in a unified social economic structure for a long time .
moreover , these problems cannot completely disappear by means of education , supervision , and even crackdown .
only after the new structure comes into shape and the old structure basically withdraws from the historical scene through in - depth reform can the problems be fundamentally resolved .
nie : according to the analyses you have just made of the stages of the " progressive reform , " we are now in the stage of storming the heavily fortified positions , which means changing from the old structure to the new one .
ordinarily , various kinds of social contradictions are very conspicuous , but why does everybody , from top to bottom , emphasize that the key point of storming the fortified positions of reform lies in the reform of state - owned enterprises ?
it is still a rather long distance from the establishment of a property rights boundary and interest boundary of multiple input , as well as from an explicit market main body and legal entity as required by the modern enterprise system .
for instance , the layout of the state - owned economy is irrational , the proportion of the solely state - owned enterprises is too large , and some enterprises have failed to set up appropriate state assets management organizations or lacked capital contributors after they broke off their links with the government departments .
it is precisely because of this that the problem of state enterprise reform has for the first time become the central committee plenum 's principal subject for discussion .
zang : according to my macroscopic ideas on reform , we should have a good grasp of the following relationships : 1 .
however , reform cannot replace development , so we should pay serious attention to the issue of industrial structural adjustment and upgrading .
just as comrade xiaoping said : reform and opening up is a move that will determine china 's destiny , to which we must keep a clear head . 2 .
another expression of the reform of the public ownership realization forms is the reform of the enterprises ' property organizational forms , which means changing the enterprises ' ownership from their extremely pure public - owned or state - owned nature to a mixed ownership with the state controlling or jointly holding enterprises ' stocks .
intensification of management is an eternal theme of enterprises .
in the final analysis , we need a good structure and mechanism .
that is why departing from reform to grasp management will do in a small number of enterprises but will not do in a majority of them ; and it will work for a short period of time but will not work for a long time .
we face arduous tasks in strengthening and improving our ideological and political work in the new period .
ideals and beliefs are a practical embodiment of people 's political convictions and world perspectives .
our party 's goal is to realize communism . in the current phase , our party 's goal is to construct socialism with chinese characteristics .
communist ideals and beliefs are the most lofty ideals and beliefs in the history of humankind . they not only generate the most wonderful and reasonable social system in the history of humankind , but also provide scientific perspectives on the world , values and life with which perspectives of all other beliefs cannot compete .
firm ideals and beliefs are the soul of communists . they are the spiritual pillar and source of energy for communists who never stop struggling , and no sooner does one of them fall than another steps into the breach .
so , strengthening and improving ideological and political work while focusing on strengthening people 's ideals and beliefs is an arduous and urgent task faced by party committees and political units at all levels .
currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries . our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications . faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .
to strengthen our ideals and beliefs , the most basic issue is that we must strengthen the study of marxism , leninism , mao zedong thought and , especially , deng xiaoping theory .
only marxism can lead us to deeply understand the objective laws of social development , grasp the nature of the development of the world 's situation , and not be influenced by whirlpools and adverse currents in the river of history .
to do well the work of strengthening our ideals and beliefs , we must correctly deal with the relationship between our ideals and interests .
in the past , influenced by far - left ideological trends , we indulged in empty talk about our ideals and were forbidden to talk about our interests .
the move is another cornerstone for the strengthening of japan - us military cooperation , and it signifies the military cooperation of the two sides is going deeper .
in this visit , clinton and the then - japanese prime minister hashimoto signed a programmatic document to reinforce the japan - us alliance , that is , " the us - japan joint declaration on security : alliance for the 21 st century . "
the declaration redefined the alliance as not limited to the purpose of pure defense , but with an aim to intervene in regional and even global affairs .
this means that the japan - us military alliance will see a change in nature .
the second phase is giving legal status to the alliance .
the governments of japan and the united states released the new " guidelines for japan - us defense cooperation . "
this , undoubtedly , has sowed the seeds of misfortune for the security of the region or even the globe .
the first big move was to join hands to develop tmd [ theater missile defense ] under the pretext of the " dprk launched a long - range ballistic missile . "
on 16 august 1999 , japan and the united states exchanged notes and signed a memorandum on developing tmd together .
right after that , on 21 august , the japanese defense agency , listed 2.1 billion japanese yen in the budget of 2000 for the single purpose of developing tmd .
reportedly , in future japan - us joint military maneuvers , the organ will be responsible for deploying the two armies , collecting information , and stipulating and transmitting joint maneuver plans for logistics support .
it is obvious that the establishment of the new headquarters will move japan - us military cooperation to a newer and higher level .
all the signs have led to the conclusion that with the establishment of the joint command headquarters , a series of moves will be observed from the japanese - us military cooperation endeavor .
instead , the central bank will adopt a more flexible exchange rate system and widen the yuan 's floating scope against the us dollar .
the chinese government has never announced any target exchange rate , and therefore is not obliged to maintain the yuan exchange rate at a particular level .
under the current exchange rate system , the trend of the yuan exchange rate against the us dollar is mainly determined by the balance of payments .
a surplus in international balance of payments suggests that demand for the us dollar will be smaller than supply and that the pressure of the yuan 's devaluation this year is virtually non - existent .
it is perhaps more appropriate to call the exchange rate the outcome rather than the reason of economic activities .
if this misunderstanding can be righted , the government will be able to win some space for resolving its domestic economic problems .
for example , it can further lower interest rates to stimulate domestic demand without having to worry about the pressure of the yuan 's devaluation .
free convertibility will definitely become a reality in the long term , this also represents the direction for the development of the yuan exchange rate system .
on an operational level , the combination of a more flexible exchange rate system with a more freely convertible foreign exchange system is easier to implement than the combination of a fixed exchange rate system with free convertibility .
this position has remained consistent from then until now , solid and unmoving . we will in no way allow any power to change in any way the status of the resolve that taiwan is one part of china .
chairman jiang 's talk set out the essentials of the " peaceful unification , one country , two systems " policy , thereby giving expression to the consistency and continuity of our party and government with respect to solution of the taiwan question .
the successful practice of " one country , two systems " in hong kong and macao confirms that this is the best way of resolving the taiwan question .
official conclusion of cross - straits antagonism under the one china principle is an essential step in carrying forward the development of cross - straits relations .
any and all issues are negotiable under the one china principle , including all the various issues that are of concern to the taiwan government .
the media and the academic , industrial and business circles on taiwan island have been the most enthusiastic and the most active in expressing their opinions . people are all expecting that the cross - strait relations will continue to develop toward reunification .
the reunification of the motherland accords with the feelings of the people and the general trend of events ; it is where the fundamental interest of all the chinese people , including the people in taiwan , lies ; and it is an irresistible historical trend .
during the five years , the political , economic , social and other achievements made by our country have attracted worldwide attention . we have deepened our reform , increased our strength , raised our international standing , expanded our influence and improved our living standard .
the facts have proven that deng xiaoping 's " one country , two systems " concept has a great vitality and it is the best way to solve the taiwan question .
according to the bilateral agreement on joining wto as a member , china 's reduction of tariffs will go through a gradual course and the import of international commodities , which are sold cheaper than domestic products , will also increase gradually year by year .
using the consumer price index will be conducive to conforming with international customs and also conducive to making comparison and analysis with most countries in the world .
these measures play an important role in improving the natural environment and promoting the continuous development of the economy and society . however , there are still problems in some areas of cutting trees , using forest lands for unauthorized purposes and damaging forests without restraint .
this further damages the natural environment and causes severe losses in state and collective assets . the masses respond strongly to this .
driven by short - term interests , some areas cut forests and denude areas on the sly . management departments of some areas connive and shield people who cut and steal trees . sometimes management departments even cooperate with people who cut and steal trees .
moreover , some areas will become poor again . so it is imperative and urgent to take effective measures and strengthen law enforcement in order to protect forest resources and improve the natural environment . we must further improve our understanding of the importance of protecting forest resources .
they must fully understand that protecting and developing forest resources have important meaning for society . it is a long - term and arduous task . it is also an important duty for party committees and governments at all levels .
party committees and governments at all levels must conscientiously implement the system in which leading cadres at all levels are responsible for attaining given objectives for protecting and developing forest resources when they are in their posts .
we must further strengthen publicity of this cause .
we must take care to sum up , promote and cultivate progressive exemplary figures who emerge in protecting forest resources and improving the natural environment . at the same time , we must also deal severely with criminals who damage forest resources and the natural environment despite the government 's effort to crack down on them .
when protecting forest resources , we must persist in managing forests according to law .
we must severely crack down on various activities which damage forest resources , such as cutting trees without authorization , cutting trees secretly and stealing them , using forest land for other purposes without authorization , turning forests into cultivated lands , transporting wood illegally , operating wood - related businesses illegally and processing wood illegally .
we must comprehensively improve the quality of forest - resource management and law enforcement personnel . we must improve the level of administration according to law . leading cadres at all levels , especially leaders of forestry - management departments , must become examples of abiding by the law and executing the law .
it is rare to have such a variety of opportunities joining the wto means that china , a leading trader in agricultural products , will gain its rightful place in the world 's largest trade organization , and this will bring a variety of opportunities for china 's agriculture and grain production operations .
i now focus on explaining the following three points .
in the 21 st century , the scope of international trade will be mainly formulated by a variety of multilateral trade structures , with the wto as the main player .
so long as we further improve the variety structure and optimize quality , these agricultural products will enjoy advantages in both quality and price , and we can further expand our exports and take a bigger share of the international market .
it will help us in importing new varieties and new technology for restructuring agriculture and grain , modernizing china 's agriculture and grain industry is a systems project that includes innovation in industrial system , changes in operational methods , and optimization of market structure and resource allocation .
since the agricultural and grain production resources are not evenly distributed , optimizing their allocation needs to be carried out through the country and indeed throughout the world ; we should launch exchanges of technology and varieties to make up for each other 's deficiencies from each other 's strong points .
before the reform and opening up , china 's agricultural and grain plate was basically " confined " in a self - enclosed circle , and its development was seriously constrained .
the wto is an open and free international trading organization based on market economy .
as far as grain trade is concerned , the tariff rate within the quota is 1 to 3 percent , and outside the quota it is 66 to 80 percent .
the challenge to the agricultural products market .
china has reaped bumper harvests year after year since the mid-1990's , and grain and other main products have changed from constraint by resources to dual constraint by market and resources ; a situation of phased and structural excess of supply over demand has emerged .
in the past 10 years , however , china 's grain production costs have been increasing at an average annual rate of 10 percent , and the prices are now higher than those on the international market .
under these supply - demand and price conditions , increased entry into the quota market may bring three challenges to our agricultural produce market , namely in quality , quantity , and price , which will have an unfavorable impact on the main producing areas of grain and other leading products .
and abundant resources and arable land are the advantages of certain countries , where production is on a large scale , production costs are low , and returns are high .
this determines that after joining the wto , many of china 's agricultural products are bound to face the challenge of low - tariff imports .
the challenge to peasant incomes and the employment of labor .
the import of foreign agricultural products will have an impact on the income sources and job opportunities for china 's peasants , who are small - scale producers .
in particular , in north and northeast china , which are the main producing areas of wheat , maize , and soybeans , nonagricultural sectors are relatively weak , so the pressure on peasant incomes and employment will be somewhat greater .
objectively speaking , the pressure and challenges posed by wto accession are normal .
there are all kinds of misunderstandings in china regarding wto accession .
the main reasons for these misunderstandings are : lack of understanding of the wto and its rules ; lack of clear understanding of the all - round situation in china 's agriculture and grain production and world economic development trends ; and inability to understand in a dialectical way the relations between two kinds of resources and two markets .
again , the view that grain imports will threaten china 's grain security is also groundless .
calculating from the current domestic grain production of 500 million tons , 5 percent grain import is 25 million tons .
supposing that by the end of the buffer period in 2004 the whole amount permitted into the quota market has been imported , the maximum amount imported would be only 21.8 million tons , 3.2 million less than 25 million .
moreover china 's all - round grain production capacity is stable at 500 million tons , and we firmly control the state grain reserves and initiative in grain import and export .
wto accession is not an industrial concept but a concept of setup or organizational system .
to grasp the initiative after wto accession , we must deepen the reforms , and establish a circulation setup and enterprise system suited to the demands of an open and liberalized trade setup and the intensive international market competition .
after wto accession , it will be all the more urgent to establish a highly efficient and flexible agricultural produce foreign trade system with few links and low costs .
the current reform of breakthrough significance is the new setup that coordinates and unifies the separate internal and external trade systems for agricultural produce , that is , achieving integration of domestic and foreign trade in this produce in the form of joint management or joint operations , and adopting the new form of agency services in foreign trade .
for instance , wto member - states can take antidumping measures in accordance with antidumping and antisubsidy accords .
by referring to foreign methods , china should formulate an " agricultural produce antidumping law " as soon as possible as a precaution against lawless foreign speculators and in order to effectively protect our domestic market stability .
therefore , no matter whether viewed from an economic or a political angle , this is an event of both great immediate importance and profound historic significance .
to successfully carry out our work in these fields , we should proceed from the country 's overall economic situation and strategic needs , suit measures to local conditions , make an overall plan and coordinate work in different aspects , adopt a leading approach as appropriate , and accelerate the construction of infrastructural facilities in the western region .
we should uphold the strategy of invigorating the country through science and education , and work hard to enhance the scientific and technological level of the western development .
we should give priority to the development of education ; particularly , we should make nine - year compulsory education universal and wipe out illiteracy among young and middle - aged people .
to promote the large - scale development of the western region , we should gear ourselves to changes in the country 's economic structure and its economic growth pattern , adopt a new way of thinking , explore new methods , and build up new mechanisms .
through our unremitting efforts , we aim to build up a new western region with beautiful mountains and rivers where the economy is flourishing , the society is undergoing constant progress , and people of different nationalities are united as one .
the construction of rural grassroots party organizations is long - term basic task . in the new period of the development of agriculture and the rural economy , we can only strengthen this work and cannot weaken it .
so we must continuously and truly improve the general level of the construction of rural grassroots party organizations .
however , some areas sometimes work hard in this field and sometimes slacken in this work .
this shortsighted activity in the work of constructing rural grassroots party organizations must be corrected as soon as possible .
we must not only attach importance to the consciousness of party committees in all areas in focusing on their own party construction , but also rely on party committees in all areas in supervising , urging and checking lower - level party committees .
they must go deep into townships and villages and directly listen to the opinions of grassroots cadres and masses . they must obtain firsthand information , help grassroots people solve their problems and promote the development of their work .
all this has fed the swollen arrogance of lee teng - hui [ li denghui ] and the taiwan independence forces of splitting up the motherland , and is an important root cause of tension in the situation of the taiwan strait .
at the end of this century , hong kong and macao were returned to the motherland one after another within the " one country , two systems " framework .
president jiang zemin pointed out at the new year reception of the cppcc national committee that the return of hong kong and macao to the motherland indicated that the country had made important headway in achieving the motherland 's complete reunification .
meanwhile , the changes in taiwan 's political situation have also made the settlement of the taiwan issue more urgent .
while the two sides of the strait are still in a state of hostility since the taiwan issue appeared several decades ago , the two sides do agree on one fundamental issue , namely there is but one china and taiwan is part of chinese territory .
in the 1980 's , the situation in the taiwan strait began to ease , the two sides were not as estranged as before , and personnel contacts and economic and cultural exchanges between the two sides also began to develop rapidly .
in recent years , however , what used to be covert secessionist activities of " taiwan independence " advocates have become increasing more overt and rampant .
what is even more worrisome is the fact that certain leaders of the taiwan authorities have brazenly gone against the one china principle step by step .
government leaders of the motherland maintain that , while the fight against the " two - state theory " has achieved significant results , the taiwan strait is still ridden by potentially serious crisis , and that they must still be highly alert of the development of the political situation on the island .
as the " presidential campaign " is currently going on in taiwan , people are particularly concerned with the development of taiwan 's political situation .
the media have come to notice that the third " if " is unprecedented and its meaning is clear and specific . it states in no uncertain term that the chinese government will not allow the taiwan issue to remain unresolved indefinitely .
when the " two sessions " were held last year , jiang zemin , qian qichen , tang jiaxuan and other leaders stated time and again that the taiwan issue could not remain unresolved indefinitely , and many cppcc national committee members also stated the need to intensify cross - strait exchanges and promote national reunification .
now significant changes have taken place in taiwan and cross - strait relations during the past year . more than ever before people are following closely the motherland 's reunification process , which is now at a crucial period .
the taiwan issue has become a national topic of discussion .
as we were limited by a lack of sufficient data at the time , we just made calculations for that 10 - year period in concluding that grain production costs in china ( the costs per 50 kg of grain ) had risen at an annual average of about 10 percent during that period .
when analyzing the changes in grain production costs during the 20 years of rural reforms , we have taken 1978 as the base year and 1997 as the comparison year .
in china , the main grain crops are rice , wheat , maize , millet , sorghum , and soybeans ; rice , wheat , and maize account for over 86 percent of the country 's grain production .
when analyzing the grain production costs over 20 years , if we use the relevant figure for production costs per mu , its comparability is affected by the increase in the per - mu yield .
if however we use the figure for production costs per 50 kg of grain , we can more accurately reflect the real trends of change over many years .
the people 's commune system was still in effect in 1978 . the investigation was carried out on 273,264 mu of grain in 1,978 production teams ; in 1997 it was carried out on 191,219 mu of grain farmed by 10,592 households in 1,652 counties .
the grain production costs in china are mainly divided into three main parts , namely material expenditure , the cost of labor , and tax .
in 1978 the tax - inclusive production cost of 50 kg of grain was 11.14 yuan , and in 1997 it was 51.93 yuan , from which we reached the figure of an annual rise of 8.44 percent over the 19 years .
in 1978 the average state price for procuring 50 kg of grain was 11.28 yuan , and in 1997 the average sale price was 68.56 yuan , having increased by 9.96 percent a year over the 19 years .
in the statistical analysis , the average figures may cover quite big fluctuations .
hence , it is necessary to carefully analyze the actual data for the tax - inclusive grain production costs and average selling prices for each year , and the changes in them ( the relevant material is in attached tables 1 and 2 ) [ tables not displayed ] .
hence , it can be said that the rise of grain production costs has the nature of a trend .
the net return rate on production costs was only 1.15 percent .
after the rural reforms , the peasants gained operational decision - making powers , and changes gradually occurred in grain production costs .
again , 2.8 draft animal work units [ xu gong , 3964 1562 ] were required per mu in 1978 , but only 1.16 in 1997 , the latter being 41.43 percent of the former .
as for labor units [ yong gong liang , 3938 1562 6852 ] per mu , the figure dropped from 28.6 in 1978 to 13.5 in 1997 , a decline of 52.8 percent .
labor costs only rose during the period because the cost of a working day rose from 0.8 yuan to 10 yuan .
labor expenditure in taiwan is only nearly one - third of total production costs ; the rest is material expenditure ; whereas on the mainland material and labor expenditure each account for half the total .
taiwan uses two labor units per mu , while the mainland uses about 20 . 2 .
expenditure on fertilizer in taiwan is relatively low , accounting for about 8 percent , whereas on the mainland the proportion exceeds 19 percent . 4 .
under these production cost structures , taiwan 's paddy production costs in 1990 were at least 100 percent higher than the international level , while the mainland 's costs were below that level at the time .
only three or four years later , however , around 1994 , china 's grain production costs , including paddy rice , were higher than the international average , and so far there has been no way of reversing this .
in reality , although the cost of land - substitute technology is increasing , it cannot catch up with the increase in the cost of labor - substitute technology .
this trend of development has caused the situation today where china 's grain production costs are already higher than the international level even though china 's agriculture is far from achieving modernization .
this has already had a major impact on the process of china 's modernization , and it will play a role in the next one or two decades or even longer .
hence , it is expected that for quite a long time to come , it will be very important to strive to reduce the proportion of labor costs in grain production costs .
given also the impact of natural disasters , fluctuations in china 's grain production can hardly be avoided ; in particular , since 1984 there has roughly been a three - year small cycle and a six - year large cycle fluctuation .
the marketable rate of china 's grain is generally held to be about 30 percent ; not more than 50 percent of the marketable grain - - that is , 15 percent of total grain output - - is ordered or bought at negotiated prices by the state .
hence , over half the peasants ' surplus grain is sold in the market , and the fluctuations in its price are rather greatly affected by supply - demand relations , and quite a small shortage or surplus will cause quite big fluctuations in market price .
in particular , although the state has openly bought the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices since 1996 , the average selling price has actually declined year on year ; by 1998 the cumulative drop was 20.02 percent , and the selling price that year was lower than in 1995 .
this was because working day costs dropped from 10 yuan in 1997 to 9.6 yuan in 1998 , a drop of 4 percent .
in 1998 the number of working days was the same as in the previous year , and the number of people supported by each agricultural laborer fell slightly from 1.56 to 1.55 compared with 1997 , a small change ( 0.64 percent ) .
the reason for this reduction , as verified by the state planning commission , was that their actual income from grain declined , and not because they reduced their expenditure in expectation of reduced income .
from the formula for calculating the cost of the working day , we can see that the number of peasant working days over the whole year ( 254 ) is identical to the working days of urban workers ( after excluding two days of rest and festivals and holidays ) .
it is worth discussing whether this calculation fully accords with china 's national condition .
the tax - inclusive production costs of grain in china rose by 8.44 percent a year from 1978 to 1997 ; in that case , will the production costs rise by such a great percentage in the next three to five years or longer ?
the year 2000 may very likely be a turning - point year ; after china joins the world trade organization [ wto ] , it is extremely likely that the speed of our economic development will increase .
if the economy heats up again in the next two or three years , and there is another big movement of peasant laborers , grain consumption is sure to rise , with the result that the grain price will increase again , the peasants ' production input will increase , and grain production costs will correspondingly rise .
summarizing the above analysis , we estimate that there will be a big decline in the rate of increase of grain production costs in the next three to five years .
in order to avoid big fluctuations in grain price , in the future it would be best if the government can readjust the grain procurement price each year in light of the supply - demand and price situation .
after china joins the wto , we must protect the interests of our grain - growing peasants as far as possible , and cannot allow too much foreign grain to hit our domestic market .
although they use different compositions of technology and key elements , the united states and japan have achieved roughly similar speed in agricultural growth .
this example is indeed very typical .
the chinese government and people by no means can tolerate ' taiwan independence ' and other splittist plots . "
this was the remark made by li zhaoxing , chinese ambassador to the united states , at a meeting today with more than 60 assistants to us congressmen .
li zhaoxing said : according to the central government 's instructions , the chinese embassy in washington will continue to strengthen contacts with taiwan compatriots , ensure their legitimate interests , and do everything we can to help them solve their difficulties .
li zhaoxing stressed : defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity is a major principle upheld by all sovereign countries .
this is the typical hegemonist logic of confusing right and wrong and calling white black and black white .
the chinese government and people ardently love peace , and " one country , two systems and peaceful reunification " is our basic principle for settling the taiwan issue .
if tensions arise in the taiwan strait , it could only be the consequence brought about by the " taiwan independence " force with li teng - hui [ li denghui ] as its general representative , with the connivance and support of some seemingly gentlemanly foreign forces which are hostile to china .
to ensure that sino - us relations develop steadily and are not impaired , the united states should abide by the principles laid down in the three sino - us joint communiques and its relevant commitments - - this is the most basic thing .
from 15 to 23 february , foreign minister tang paid an official visit to mauritania , tunisia , kuwait , and iran by invitation .
he said the " white paper " was issued within a setting of the taiwan separatist forces intensifying their efforts to block cross - strait reunification , and of some americans meddling more actively in the taiwan matter .
it was certainly not aimed at the taiwan " election , " and was not a military threat .
the only way out for taiwan is for the taiwan authorities to abandon their " two - states theory , " and return to their " one china " stand .
yu shuning cited deng xiaoping 's words back then .
and he reemphasized that the " one china " principle is the key to solving the taiwan problem .
the technical negotiations this time began on 21 february and lasted four days .
the date for the next negotiations has not yet been fixed .
beijing , 24 feb (zxs) - - speaking here today , chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao formally asked the japanese government not to allow the dalai lama into japan .
japan 's tokyo governor shintaro ishihara yesterday said that he would receive and hold talks with the dalai lama in his capacity as governor .
he sternly reiterated that the dalai is a political exile who has chronically engaged in separatist activities under the cloak of religion .
china solemnly urges the japanese government to earnestly honor the commitments it has made to the chinese side and refrain from allowing the dalai into the country , so as not to create new obstructions to relations between the two countries .
commenting on this , the spokesman said that china hopes relevant activities could contribute to regional peace and stability .
li ruihuan went to yuhang city in zhejiang province from on 20 - 21 february to investigate and study the " three stresses " education of the city 's leading body and leading cadres in accordance with the unified arrangement of the central authorities and direct mobilization of the city 's leading cadres to participate in the education .
he called some retired veteran comrades and responsible persons of relevant units to a forum ; listened to the report of the city party committee on the preparatory work concerning " three stresses " education ; and delivered a speech at the meeting of the city 's leading cadres on " three stresses " education .
accompanied by provincial party secretary li dejiang , governor chai songyue , and cppcc provincial committee chairman liu feng on 21 - 24 february , li ruihuan inspected hangzhou , jiaxing , and other places .
leaders of the older generation attached particular importance to the opinions of the masses ; stressed that people should consult with the masses when matters arise ; encouraged people to first become pupils of the people before becoming their teachers ; and urged people to get the opinions of the masses and refer them back to the masses .
however , nowadays in some places the masses are less consulted and their opinions are less heeded when matters arise .
he pointed out : very often we say that serving the people wholeheartedly is the purpose of the party and the government . if we do not heed the opinions of the masses in a regular basis , how can we clearly understand what and how we should serve and how we can render better service ?
very often we say the party and the masses maintain flesh - and - blood ties , are as inseparable as fish and water , and forge a relationship of public servants ; if we do not heed the opinions of the masses on a regular basis and the two are separated , what situation and results will occur ?
as far as leading cadres are concerned , politics means uniting more people ; capability means bringing the enthusiasm of the masses into full and rational play ; and authority means making the masses satisfied and happy and enjoying their support .
we must heed the opinions of the masses on a regular basis whether circumstances are difficult or favorable or when we have free time or are fully occupied , and strive to develop it into a habit , a conscious action , and a general practice to heed the opinions of the masses .
hu xiaodi pointed out that since mankind started the utilization of outer space , acts of military utilization of outer space have never stopped .
either prospect will annul all efforts in nuclear disarmament and the prevention of proliferation .
zhou tienong , vice chairman of the cppcc national committee and executive vice chairman of the central committee of the chinese kuomintang revolutionary committee , said : the white paper was published in good time , which has clearly pointed out a direction for the development of cross - strait relations .
the one - china principle is the cornerstone of the chinese government 's policy toward taiwan .
it is best to achieve cross - strait reunification by peaceful means , that is , we should first hold dialogues and consultations .
the publication of the white paper is a great encouragement to all chinese and foreign personages who advocate and support the peaceful reunification of china and a powerful deterrent to all hegemonists , interventionists , and separatists .
the china democratic league fully supports the chinese government 's adherence to the one - china principle and policy .
we should make every possible effort to promote the settlement of the taiwan issue at an early date .
du yijin , vice chairman of the central committee of the china zhi gong dang , said : the two sides are closer to each other during the ebb tide ; china will become prosperous after its reunification .
hong fuzeng , vice chairman of the central committee of the jiusan society , stressed : the complete reunification of the motherland is not only a lofty ideal all chinese people have been hankering for but also a historic opportunity for achieving the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation in the 21 st century .
the jiusan society sincerely hopes that the chinese people on both sides of the taiwan strait will join hands at an early date and satisfactorily settle the taiwan issue and realize the complete reunification of the motherland in accordance with the basic principle of " peaceful reunification , one country , two systems . "
li minkuan , vice chairman of the taiwan democratic self - government league , said : cross - strait relations are at a critical moment .
resolution of the pntr issue represents the consensus in the agreement reached by china and the united states on china 's accession to the wto ; it conforms with the common interests of the people of china and the united states .
on the issue of choosing a new managing director to the international monetary fund [ imf ] , zhu bangzao expressed the hope that the imf would choose a new managing director as soon as possible , for the sake of normal progress in the organization 's work .
the chinese side is of the view that conditions for holding ministerial - level talks between the two sides have ripened .
shi guangsheng , chinese minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation , welcomes eu trade commissioner lamy to visit china to finally conclude the sino - eu talks on china 's wto entry .
jiang zemin stayed at guangzhou 's zhuhai guesthouse , a garden - like guesthouse used by guangdong exclusively to accommodate central leaders . ordinarily , the guesthouse is open to the public , but it had been closed for business since the afternoon of the day before .
armed policemen and public security personnel could be seen guarding along a way several hundred meters long inside the compound .
in addition , departments concerned have also found proof that he threw away money , like his dirty gambling in las vegas during his trip to the united states .
when he was mayor of shanghai , zhu rongji thought highly of zhu xiaohua , now 51 years old , when he served as vice president of the people 's bank of china shanghai branch in the 1980 s .
in 1993 , zhu rongji began to launch a large - scale rectification drive of the financial industry . after personally assuming the post of the central bank governor , he named zhu xiaohua vice governor of the central bank . zhu xiaohua was transferred to serve as director of the state administration of exchange control the next year .
when he took over the post from zhu xiaohua on 29 july 1999 , liu mingkang said : " chairman zhu is being transferred back to the mainland in a routine reshuffle . there are other arrangements waiting for him . i hope you will not give credence to rumors . "
however , later when the asian financial crisis broke out , the group 's assets greatly declined .
in the new millennium , the chinese people are welcoming the upcoming " two sessions . "
the " two sessions " to be held at the turn of the century are of extreme significance .
prior to the convocation of the " two sessions , " this reporter had interviews with some npc deputies and cppcc members on the topic of economic reform .
the deputies and cppcc members maintained that reform is advancing wider and steadily , great efforts have been made in reform , and achievements are noticeable .
the " debt - equity swap " program draws the attention of the people most .
for instance , some large key enterprises , such as anshan iron and steel company , benxi iron and steel company , china faw group corporation , and china second motor company , have turned nearly several billions of debts or nearly 10 billion yuan of debts into shares .
at present , state departments concerned have recommended , through examinations , 601 enterprises to carry out the " debt - equity swap " program and expect to help them turn 459.6 billion yuan of debts into shares .
the year 1999 was one when greatest efforts were exerted to realign and technologically transform state - owned enterprises .
after basically resolving the problems of separating government functions from enterprise management , the two large petroleum groups have materialized the integration of upper - stream products with downstream ones and made their production , supply , and marketing a coordinate process .
non - ferrous metal industries witnessed a slash in deficits after establishing aluminum , rare earth , and copper industrial groups .
last year , the central party and government organizations cut ties with the economic entities run by themselves and the enterprises under their jurisdiction ; and the army , the armed police forces , and public security , procuratorial , and judicial organs smoothly transferred the economic enterprises run by themselves to localities .
of the 530 enterprises which were divorced from the central party and government organizations , most have put their settlement plans in place . meanwhile , plans for taking over and handling more than 6,000 such economic enterprises are basically put in place .
some deputies and cppcc members maintained that thanks to the implementation of reform and various measures , a turn has been taken for getting state - owned enterprises out of plight in three years through reform .
such achievements laid a foundation for the final realization of the goal of getting state - owned enterprises out of plight in 2000 .
from now on , state - owned enterprises should conscientiously implement the spirit of the 15 th national party congress and the fourth plenary session of the 15 th cpc central committee , strategically readjust their structures , and carry out the modern enterprise system in real terms .
at present , there are more than 11 million laid - off workers from state - owned enterprises and over 27 million retirees nationwide .
last year , basic living expenses were distributed to over 90 percent of the laid - off workers , and the majority of the localities ensured to pay 98 percent of the old - age pensions in full and on schedule .
in july last year , the central authorities made a decision on raising the salaries of the urbanites with low - and medium - level incomes , thus making 80 million people nationwide enjoy this treatment .
the housing reform has constantly been a hot - debated issue affecting the people 's feelings .
in august last year , the general offices of the cpc central committee and the state council forwarded and implemented the " plan for further intensifying the housing reform among the central and state organs stationed in beijing . "
third , the pace of selling public houses was accelerated .
last year , more than 50 percent of the marketable public houses in most provinces and municipalities throughout the country were sold while over 80 percent of such houses in 10 - odd provinces , municipalities , and autonomous regions , such as chongqing , henan , and guangxi , were sold .
fourth , more efforts were made to readjust house rents .
beijing has worked out methods for readjusting house rent rates and giving house rent subsidies . after the central and state organs and beijing municipality readjust their house rent rates , the spending on house rents will account for about 10 percent of the household 's incomes .
ye rutang , deputy to the npc and vice minister of construction , said that the replacement of house distribution by payment of house subsidies and the opening of second - class house markets accord with the will of the people and the general trend .
the new system will be able to greatly help check the corrosive phenomena arising in the distribution of houses , improve the people 's living conditions , and facilitate the development of the building industry , which is a pillar industry of the national economy .
the financial , taxation , and banking reform advance steadily last year , the reform work in the financial , taxation , and banking sectors advanced steadily .
in june last year , the state once again cut banking institutions ' deposit and credit interest rates ; it was the seventh time to cut interest rates after 1996 .
in november , the state began collecting income taxes on individual deposit interests with a tax rate of 20 percent .
at the same time , the restoration of interest taxes may help promote consumption and readjust distribution , so that the state will find it convenient to concentrate increasingly more financial resources to increase the salaries of the people with low - and medium - level incomes and to promote social stability .
last year , the central bank canceled the regional restrictions on the operating branches of foreign - funded banks , thus expanding foreign - funded banks ' renminbi business scale .
on the threshold of the new century , we should be more deeply aware of the fact that reform is the motivation of development .
the gigantic achievements we made in 1999 were closely related to the in - depth reform .
editor 's note : as a member of the chinese delegation , liu yuzhu , deputy director of the market department of the ministry of culture , has on many occasions participated in the negotiations on china 's accession to the wto .
if the government manages and guides them properly , they will bring considerable benefits to the vast number of cultural consumers , to the investors engaged in cultural production and operation activities , and to the country 's economic construction .
the social system and ideology of the united states and other western countries are different from ours , and there is a great disparity in the cultural understanding and management between them and ourselves .
the management means and methods adopted by the chinese government differ a great deal from those of the western countries , which also clash with the wto 's rules .
now if we revise and abandon the original effective management means that we have been familiar with and learn the new rules with which we are unfamiliar , it will lead to the conflicts in understanding and the problem that the actual results of management do not come up to people 's expectations .
the negative impacts on china 's fine national culture .
there will be a rising trend and demand for foreign cultural programs in domestic markets not only in quantity but also in quality , as more cultural consumers will have a weakness for them .
these cultural programs that gain access to china , on one hand , suit people 's consumption requirements for diversified culture , but on the other hand have a potential impact on the traditional national culture , which will bring new challenges to the protection and development of our national culture .
the pressure on the existence of china 's cultural production units .
given our advantages of possessing cultural resources and being the host country , it is rather difficult for our cultural production units to change the inferior position to superior position , and continue to grow and expand to be still more superior in the short term .
the opportunities exist objectively the benefits of helping people to once again realize the nature , functions , and effect of the cultural industry and cultural markets , and promoting the change of their concepts and the emancipation of their minds .
the acceleration of the process of cultural institutional building . in china , the management of cultural undertakings mainly depends on policy appeals and administrative measures , and lacks legal means to guide and protect the smooth progress of cultural building and cultural activities .
only by refusing to be committed to renouncing the use of force against taiwan will it be possible to ensure taiwan 's lasting security historically , since ancient times taiwan has been an inalienable part of china , and taiwan has never changed its character of being part of china .
in terms of its geographical location , taiwan is next to the pacific ocean in the east , faces the mainland of the motherland across the taiwan strait in the west , and borders on the bashi channel in the south , being called the " fence for seven provinces " since ancient times .
the possession of taiwan , a strategically important maritime location , is critical to china 's national security .
in history , taiwan was occupied by spain , holland , and japan , respectively , and was later also used by the united states as an " unsinkable aircraft carrier . "
every time there was a breakup of china 's territory in a context of incessant warfare , china would be invaded by foreign forces ; meanwhile , several episodes of thriving development in the history of the chinese nation have all been achieved under the precondition of national unification .
a failure for taiwan to return to the embrace of the motherland will provide an exploitable opportunity for foreign intervention , a situation which will seriously threaten taiwan 's security and harm the interest of all the people of china , including taiwan compatriots .
this is one of the fundamental reasons why the government of the motherland has refused to commit itself to renouncing the use of force , while persisting in using the principles of " peaceful unification and one country , two systems " for resolving the question of taiwan .
only by returning to the embrace of the motherland at an early date will taiwan be able to have the most reliable guarantee for its security .
by committing itself to renouncing the use of force , the chinese government will no longer be able to suppress and deter attempts by " taiwan independent " forces and foreign anti - china forces to break up china .
if the government of the motherland commits itself to renouncing the use of force , " taiwan independence " forces will brazenly collude with foreign intervention forces in an effort to break up china . on the other hand , the taiwan authorities are doing everything possible to militarily confront and resist the mainland .
taiwan 's military is the taiwan authorities ' important pillar and tool for maintaining the rule of the taiwan authorities .
to achieve their evil goal of " taiwan independence , " the taiwan authorities have adopted various measures to enhance the construction of taiwan 's military .
the purpose of these military activities carried out by the taiwan authorities has been to militarily resist the mainland , peace , and unification .
any attempt by foreign or domestic forces to break up china will be doomed to failure . "
in terms of action , li has been indulgent toward and supported splittist forces advocating " taiwan independence " and their activities , resulting in the rapid development of " taiwan independence " forces and the spread of the ideological current of " taiwan independence . "
under the direction of li denghui , the taiwan authorities have adopted a series of actual splittist steps .
in the diplomatic sphere , the taiwan authorities have been carrying out so - called " pragmatic diplomacy " and " money diplomacy " in a big way , in an attempt to broaden taiwan 's so - called " international space for survival " and to create a situation of " two chinas . "
by continuing to follow this self - deceptive approach designed to deceive others , li denghui and the taiwan authorities will only end up walking in circles inside the " blind alley , " getting blooded by bumping into walls , and destroying themselves .
it is necessary to adhere to the principles of " peaceful unification and one country , two systems , " while refusing to be committed to renouncing the use of force , so that the taiwan authorities will be subject to deterring effects and have to think twice , while feeling that there is a way out .
any deterioration of the political and economic environment will bring disastrous consequences to taiwan 's economy .
the announcement of li denghui 's " two - state doctrine " has created a taiwan strait crisis and resulted in popular uneasiness in taiwan , drastic declines in stock prices , and large capital outflows , thereby directly affecting taiwan 's normal economic order and social stability .
only by being based on ties to the mainland of the motherland as in the cases of hong kong and macao will it be possible for taiwan to provide favorable guarantees for its economic development .
the unification of the motherland is in the fundamental interest of taiwan compatriots , and the refusal of the government and people of china to be committed to renouncing the use of force against taiwan is an important condition and guarantee for successfully realizing this fundamental interest of taiwan compatriots .
this is in the fundamental interest of the people on both sides of the strait , including taiwan compatriots .
therefore , the government and people of china firmly upholds the policy of refusing to be committed to renouncing the use of force against taiwan , in an effort to seek an early return of taiwan to the embrace of the motherland .
beijing , 24 february - - faced with a large - scale influx of foreign capital into china 's cable tv network , a relevant person of the state administration of radio , movie , and television , stated : " all shall be temporarily suspended pending the introduction of policies . "
as for the existing relations of cooperation , the relations of interests shall be considered . he disclosed : the relevant ministries and commissions of the state council are still discussing the policies concerned and have yet to decide on when to introduce the specific policies .
however , some listed companies in hong kong still continued their business talks on investing in the hinterland cable network business at that time , believing that the policy had little to do with them .
as for the distribution networks , the departments in charge of radio , movie , and television affairs shall build relatively comprehensive networks for special uses , namely , no two - way innovation projects for cable tv networks shall be built for the time being for the purpose of providing telecommunication services .
wu jichuan , state minister of information industry , the other day disclosed to zhongguo xinwen she that several decrees are still being formulated , including " regulations for managing foreign investment in telecommunication service trade " and " regulations for managing computer networks and information security . "
by the end of 1999 , china had built cable tv transmission networks stretching for nearly 2.5 million km , boasting nearly 100 million clients , and ranking first in the world , with some 14 provinces and cities connecting themselves to a national cable tv network .
the issuance of the white paper has evoked strong repercussions in the taiwan community and shocked taiwan 's political circles .
the white paper imposes a restriction , urging taiwan to hold a dialogue and talks with the mainland within the framework of one china , and releases a strong message , " there will be no peace without the one china principle across the strait . "
it is aimed at the tricks and means played by li teng - hui and other " taiwan independence " forces that attempt to bypass the forms of " declaring taiwan independence " to attain their objective of realizing " taiwan independence " in reality .
in order to evade the white paper , the chen shui - bian camp attempted to lessen the attack of the white paper against chen , saying that the contents of the white paper do not target chen alone .
this is indeed a clumsy denial that has resulted in self - exposure .
at the forum to mark the fifth anniversary of jiang zemin 's 8 - point proposal , vice premier qian qichen warned that " taiwan independence " was tantamount to war across the taiwan straits .
taiwan 's splittist forces should not play with fire that may burn them .
the white paper that expresses china 's determination against separation and to realize reunification clearly targets li teng - hui and chen shui - bian .
chen shui - bian also promised his voters : we will uphold taiwan 's " sovereign independence , " not allow china to " annex " taiwan , and safeguard peace across the taiwan straits ; and there will be no more wars in taiwan . this again is deceptive talk .
if chen shui - bian 's dream of " taiwan independence " is realized , he will throw taiwan into catastrophe .
taiwan compatriots , who have a glorious tradition of patriotism , are against separation and " taiwan independence . "
for the sake of the fundamental interests of the compatriots across the strait and on the question of right and wrong related to taiwan 's future , it is believed that taiwan compatriots will make a correct choice conducive to reunification of the motherland .
beijing , 24 feb ( ta kung pao ) - - the negotiations between china and the european union (eu) on china 's accession to the world trade organization (wto) have ended this afternoon .
in the view of experts here , the 15 - member eu has outstripped the united states in terms of gross domestic product and commercial capability .
zhu rongji positively assessed the momentum of development in bilateral relations in recent years .
over the past year , the npc standing committee examined and deliberated 30 draft laws and adopted 19 of them , fulfilling in the main the annual plan for legislation .
to meet the need of the continuous development of reform , opening up and modernization drive , the npc standing committee timely made revisions on related laws , such as the income tax law , the highway law , the criminal law and the company law .
as a result , those laws have become more suitable to objective reality and can play more active roles in regulating social and economic activities .
last year , attention was also paid to ensuring the impartiality of various departments and the work of drafting laws by special committees was further improved .
people of various circles have expressed their opinion that the members of the npc standing committee have attached greater importance to supervision and practical results and have gone down to the grassroots level without pomp .
the standing committees of people 's congresses at various local levels also gave full play to their supervisory roles , had the courage of exploring truth , and gained numerous experiences in supervising individual cases and evaluating and redressing erroneous cases .
the npc standing committee has paid good attention to those experiences .
this is a situation that warrants our great attention .
the incident , which occurred on 25 april last year when " falungong " practitioners illegally gathered around the zhongnanhai , is something that merits special attention .
therefore , it still is an urgent task to strengthen education on the scientific spirit .
a book entitled " mao zedong , deng xiaoping , and jiang zemin on ideological and political work " was published recently . the contents of the book have fully embodied , in a systematic manner , expositions of the leading leaderships of the three generations on ideological and political work .
among these problems and contradictions , the most outstanding one is this : the condition of spiritual civilization in our society still cannot meet the need of the drive of reform and opening up as well as the construction of the market economy .
being unable to stand the tests under the new situation , a small number of people have wavered in their ideals , faith , and sense of values .
this is the reason deputies and representatives to the current " two sessions " show their special concern about the construction of spiritual civilization .
cao yaqin , a falungong practitioner , changed his mind many times but ended up refusing to come to his senses on the question of falungong .
zhang xiaozhen , former head of the economic police unit of the public security department of the jinxi machinery plant , had been a falungong practitioner . to educate and help him , the plant party committee arranged to have him work on night shifts .
zhang , who had stayed home after being dismissed from his work and encountered economic difficulties , was deeply moved . he pledged of his own accord to completely break away from falungong and return to the correct position on the side of the party and the people .
many prefectures , counties , and units in shanxi province have instituted a system of responsibility at every level for educating and transforming falungong practitioners .
grass - roots organizations in fenxi county instituted a system of responsibility for converting falungong practitioners . the county set up a network for helping and educating falungong practitioners . lin yuping , secretary of the zuoquan county party committee , contracted to help and convert several falungong practitioners .
du litao , a student of the 9752 class of the computer science and engineering department at the taiyuan heavy machinery college , began to practice falungong in 1996 out of curiosity .
after his return to the college , the college party committee continued to educate and help him , insisting on chatting with him once every week .
li lanqing said emphatically that general secretary jiang zemin takes education very seriously , so we must conscientiously study and put into practice his important instructions on intensifying and improving the education work and correctly guiding and helping young students in their healthy growth and their all - round development in morality , intelligence , physique , and aesthetics .
it is necessary to guide the schools and teachers in carrying out the education on quality through their teaching materials , teaching programs , teaching methods , teaching means , appraisal by examination , and other contents and methods .
the surroundings of schools must be seriously renovated . the schools and pertinent departments must take a clear - cut stand to oppose the unhealthy trends and evil practices among the students so that schools will become places filled with the atmosphere of devoted study to make progress under good discipline .
they must seriously set right the situation in some places where the students ' burdens of lessons are too heavy and their psychological pressures are too large to be tolerated .
li lanqing said : education is a systems engineering , and the education at school , at home , and in society are the three major pillars of education , which call for all social sectors to create a good environment for the healthy growth of the adolescents with concerted efforts .
li lanqing also made important suggestions on how to accelerate the existing educational structural reform and adjustment , enhance the quality of the teachers , achieve a diversified educational structure at multiple levels , and intensify the building of a contingent of teachers .
comrades in charge of pertinent sections including xu rongkai , zhang zhixin , and zhang baoqing also accompanied li lanqing in his inspection .
a batch of battleships , aircraft , land weapons , precision - guidance missiles , and electronic telecommunications equipment of advanced performance has been successfully developed and used to equip our troops .
meanwhile , breakthroughs have also been made in the project of manned space flight .
our study and research of high technologies has successfully shortened our gap with the world 's advanced level , and has provided both a technological source and a strong driving force for efforts to accelerate the weaponry modernization of our army .
the presentation and distribution ceremony was presided over by li jinai , political commissar of the general weaponry department .
changsha , 25 february ( xinhua ) - - yiyang city 's heshan district people 's court made a judgement days ago , sentencing cai youwei , former deputy director of the flood prevention office under the yiyang water resources and hydropower bureau , to 10 years in prison for embezzling flood prevention funds .
from october 1993 to november 1997 , cai youwei , individually or together with others , embezzled money by hiding income and making false reports of expenditures . he made such offenses five times and embezzled 29,000 yuan .
as of 7 january this year , the heshan people 's court has concluded trials and examinations in the cases and also sentenced cao lilin , liu guming , and jiang lianke to set terms of imprisonment .
luo gan said : in strengthening the construction of the grassroots contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel , we should focus on the following five aspects : first , it is necessary to conscientiously strengthen the construction of the leading groups of grassroots judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .
in accordance with the plan made by the cpc central committee , we should do a good job in conducting the " three stresses " campaign among the leading groups of people 's courts , people 's procuratorates , and public security departments at the county level .
third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .
we should carry out a special task to reform organizations and consolidate those people who have not been recruited in accordance with regulations and who are not suitable for their jobs . in this way , we can continuously strengthen the invigoration and fighting capacity of the contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .
fourth , we should continue to carry out the " civilization promotion " activities and promote law enforcement with justice .
fifth , we should run the party strictly . we should conscientiously strengthen the construction of grassroots party organizations and bring into full play the model and leading role of party members .
luo gan emphatically said : party committees , governments , as well as judicial , procuratorial , and public security departments at all levels should put the work high on their agenda . they should conscientiously strengthen their leadership .
members of the central commission of political science and law , including xiao yang , han zhubin , jia chunwang , xu yongyao , gao changli , zhou ziyu , and wang shengjun , attended the meeting .
responsible comrades of the supreme people 's court , the supreme people 's procuratorate , the ministry of public security , and the ministry of justice spoke at the meeting . they explained their own systems ' plans for strengthening the construction in this aspect .
also around that time , chen haiyan and others fraudulently obtained business registrations by false capital investment to successively set up in xiangtan and shenzhen phantom companies such as the dayang limited - liability company and dayang industrial company and then contracted for the xiangtan yuhu trading company .
you must have dayang in mind , show concern for dayang , and care for dayang . " he also assigned rigid profit targets to the private companies under their charge to encourage and support their serving the interest of the private companies by various means at the expense of the xwcgc .
in name , the " dayang company " paid no salary to these so - called " life senior staff members ; " in reality , it deposited their salaries into their special personal accumulation fund accounts .
in addition , the xwcgc bore the " dayang company 's " loan interest losses totaling over 850,000 yuan .
to change these companies into " joint - venture " or " cooperative " enterprises overnight , his gang cheated intermediary institutions by providing false financial information and proceeded to obtain business registrations by fraud .
draw lessons from bitter experience that stimulates deep thought chen haiyan 's gang did great damage to the xwcgc 's production and operation as well as social stability with their premeditated , organized , planned , and wanton transferring and embezzlement of state - owned assets .
through the voluminous archival materials , the course of decline and bitter lesson of the xwcgc stimulate deep thought .
lesson no. 1 : it is a long - term , arduous task to reform soes .
in 1993 , the xwcgc leaders then wanted to introduce foreign capital on the occasion of putting its electromagnetic wire branch factory into full - scale production .
in the absence of in - depth investigation and study , they simply listened to chen haiyan 's sweet talk and blindly believed him and then rashly reached a final decision to close the deal .
yet , the xwcgc leaders , whose brains were muddled with eagerness for quick success and instant benefit , still decided to contract for the operation of this joint - venture enterprise and entrusted chen haiyan , who had long left the xwcgc , with the powers for operation and management .
the xwcgc case has sounded the alarm once again for us .
jiang zemin was very happy to see the economic development , urban construction , and the tremendous changes in the people 's material and cultural life in shenzhen .
jiang zemin pointed out that after carrying out reform and opening up in the past 20 years and more , tremendous achievements have been made in the economic and social development of our country and the people 's living standard has been remarkably improved .
the reason for doing so is to encourage all the people of the country to bravely forge ahead along the correct road of reform , opening up and socialist modernization , and to realize the magnificent goal of the cross - century development of our country .
on 22 february , jiang zemin went deep into nanling village of buji town , longgang district , shenzhen city , and had an informal discussion on party building at the grass - roots level with members of the party branch and party - member representatives of the villagers .
during his inspection tour , jiang zemin came to the shenzhen city high - tech industry park , listened to reports on the development of the high - tech industries in shenzhen city , and went to see exhibits of high - tech products .
at that time , china was in a miserable state of political darkness , and turmoil and the chaos of war , and the chinese had no means of livelihood . it was totally impossible for china to catch up with the advanced current of the world 's science and technology development .
the socialist china of today certainly has the conditions and ability to catch up with the advanced current of the development of the world 's science and technology and to bring about greater development of the chinese nation .
the conditions of the eastern region are relatively better and this region should strive to basically realize socialist modernization first and make greater contribution to building socialism with chinese characteristics .
in this sense , our tasks of promoting reform , opening up and modernization are even more formidable .
speaking about the implementation of the strategy for the general development of the western region , jiang zemin said that speeding up the development of the central and western regions is an important policy - decision made by the party central committee to promote the cross - century development of our country .
the strategy for the general development of the western region will also inevitably provide more opportunities for the development of the eastern region , and the eastern region can make fuller use of the resources and market of the western region to promote its own development .
party committees and governments at all levels must earnestly and properly grasp the building of the spiritual civilization while persistently taking economic construction as the center , and continue to obtain excellent results in the building of both the material civilization and the socialist spiritual civilization .
if management is properly carried out and the rule of law is strengthened , loopholes for violations of law and crimes will be plugged . meting out punishment according to law for those who have violated law and discipline will serve to warn and educate the broad masses of cadres and people .
it is necessary to step up ideological and political education for leading cadres at all levels .
with the development of the economy and the improvement in livelihood , leading cadres still have to maintain the fine style of working hard and perseveringly .
all communists , especially leading cadres , must be loyal and devoted , and work hard for the party and the people without being upset by criticism . with such a spirit , one will certainly be able to make achievements in work .
jiang zemin fully affirmed the guangzhou military region for comprehensively strengthening army building and for satisfactorily fulfilling various important tasks assigned by the party central committee and the cmc .
participants in the forum pointed out that the one - china principle is the foundation for the cross - strait peaceful reunification as well as the cornerstone of cross - strait economic and trade development .
the chinese government and people did not , do not , and will not compromise and change in this issue , nor allow anyone to challenge the one - china principle .
yu xiaosong maintained that along with the smooth return of hong kong and macao to the motherland , the cross - strait relations have entered a new stage and face a major opportunity of development while entering the new millennium .
this has also showed the chinese government 's determination to persistently implement the principles of " peaceful reunification and one country , two systems " and chairman jiang zemin 's eight proposals and to promote the sound development of the cross - strait relations under the one - china principle .
economic and trade contacts and exchanges between the two sides of the straits have opened more markets and opportunities for the further development of taiwan 's economy . the mainland china has already become one of the most essential trade partners of taiwan and the biggest market of taiwan 's products .
this has been shown by the data of the direct trade transactions between the two sides over the past five years .
while accelerating the pace of entering the world trade organization , the mainland china will further open its markets , expand its investment reach , and improve its investment environment . as a result , taiwan compatriots will face a huge market filled with boundless business opportunities and development potentials .
the two sides exchanged in a deep - going way views on how to further develop the ties between the two countries and reached an extensive common understanding .
at the turn of the century , general secretary jiang zemin and general secretary le kha phieu set a framework for relations oriented toward the 21 st century and characterized by " long - term stability , future orientation , good - neighborliness , and all - around cooperation , thus marking a new era for bilateral relations .
tang jiaxuan said : at the beginning of this year , the chinese and vietnamese peoples solemnly celebrated the 50 th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties .
nguyen dy nien said : vietnam and china are friendly socialist neighbors who are linked by common mountains and rivers .
the peoples of the two countries have showed mutual empathy and support throughout the long - term revolutionary struggle .
the vietnamese communist party , government , and people will never forget the tremendous support and assistance provided by the chinese communist party , government , and people .
the " china - vietnam land border treaty " formally signed by the two countries on 30 december 1999 is of great historic significance .
the two sides also extensively exchanged opinions on international and regional issues of common concern .
what do the people 's congress and its standing committee supervise ?
in a nutshell , they supervise the enforcement of the constitution and laws and the work of the " government , the people 's procuratorate , and the people 's court . "
based on the content , the supervision includes legal supervision and work supervision .
president jiang 's inspection in guangdong will propel guangdong to move up to a new stage in the undertaking of opening up and reform and the building of socialist modernization , and take a bigger step forward on the path of progress .
president jiang emphasized : the key to handling well the affairs in china lies in the communist party , and in the ideology , style , organization , discipline situation , capacity to struggle , and the level of the leadership of the party .
the " three stresses " education is still the core of the main emphases in the work of party building this year , and the party committees at all levels must make conscientious efforts to implement the education .
he urged the cadres to be honest in performing their official duties , work diligently in defiance of difficulties , be upright , work honestly and sincerely , and serve the people wholeheartedly .
this year marks the 20 th anniversary of the establishment of the special economic zones in china .
the instruction of deng xiaoping says the correct line , principles , and policies regarding the reform and opening up and modernization formulated by our party is the fundamental guarantee for bringing about rapid economic and social development of our country .
president jiang is very interested in and attaches great importance to the adjustment of the economic structure and the development of the industry of high new technology . he inspected some enterprises in shenzhen , and watched the exhibition of products of high new technology .
however , it was utterly impossible for china , overwhelmed by a dark political situation and turmoil and chaos of war , with the masses living in dire poverty and in a miserable state , to catch up with the advanced trend of developing science and technology in the world .
nowadays , at the dawn of the 21 st century , regardless of the look of china , or the economic and social life of the world , there have been great changes of historic significance in comparison with the situation 100 years ago .
after the chinese government published a white paper on the taiwan issue , there has been a noise from across the great ocean that is against china 's resorting to force against taiwan to accomplish the great cause of reunifying the motherland when it has no other choice .
after the white paper was published , spokesman for the us state department rubin indicated , " we reject the use of force or the threat of force as a way of settling the taiwan issue . "
that this issue has dragged on for a half century and remained unresolved precisely is the result of intervention by foreign forces including the united states .
all this has fed lee teng - hui [ li teng - hui ] and pro - taiwan independence forces ' arrogance of splitting the motherland and constituted a major root of tensions in the taiwan strait .
in the meantime , however , china cannot but get well - prepared for settling the taiwan issue in a non - peaceful way .
the chinese government and people have all along been uncompromising and lived up to their word on such major issues of principle as defending state sovereignty and territorial integrity .
the us government 's professing of rejection of the use of force or threat of force against taiwan is just like a war monger reciting " peace scriptures . "
the united states has showed off its military prowess around the world and has at every turn used force or threatened to use force , playing the bully and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries .
last year it unleashed violent strikes in kosovo , wantonly and indiscriminately bombing the federal republic of yugoslavia for more than 70 days .
the common people of iraq may become victims of us warplanes practically any day .
at a time when there is a possibility that china would use force to defend its state sovereignty and territorial integrity , under circumstances essentially different from those when the united states resorts to force , the united states has come out to obstruct unreasonably , making its hegemonist features all too clear .
the taiwan issue is an internal affair of china ; if the united states insists on intervening in it , sino - us relations certainly will suffer a serious setback and the chinese government and people will have to steel themselves to take on the united states right to the end .
in bringing about reunification of the motherland lie the chinese nation 's overall interests , major principle , and cardinal principles of righteousness .
mr. sun yat - sen [ sun zhongshan ] once said : " unification is the hope for all the people of china .
if we can unify , the whole nation will live in ease and comfort ; if we cannot , the whole nation will live in misery . "
no force on earth can stop the chinese people from accomplishing the great cause of reunifying their motherland and they will surely achieve the magnificent goal of bringing about national reunification .
by adhering to the principle of " persistently building both material and spiritual civilizations and attaching equal importance to both , " zhangjiagang city has launched extensively various activities of building the spiritual civilization , and remarkable success has achieved in this regard .
in zhangjiagang on 23 february , li peng listened to the work reports on jiangsu province , suzhou city , and zhangjiagang city , and held a forum to discuss with the responsible comrades in the province and cities on the situation of implementing the " three stresses " education .
he first explained in an all - round way the necessity , importance , and urgency of the " three stresses " education .
li peng pointed out : it is necessary to implement in an all - round way the demands of the central authorities regarding the implementation of the " three stresses " education in counties ( cities ) , and resolve the outstanding problems existing in the party character and party style .
comrade jiang zemin said : " the three stresses on learning , politics , and healthy trends are closely linked and mutually unified , and the core lies in the stress of politics . "
it is necessary to formulate plans and measures of rectification and reform , and make conscientious efforts to implement various measures of rectification and reform .
rectification and reform should not be postponed and conducted at the last stage , instead , it is necessary to closely integrate rectification and reform with the reality of the work , learning while conducting reforms , and rectifying while conducting reforms .
from 22 to 25 february , accompanied by hui liangyu , secretary of the jiangsu provincial cpc committee , chen huanyou , chairman of the jiangsu provincial people 's congress standing committee , and governor ji yunshi , li peng successively went to jiangyang , zhangjiagang , and wuxi cities to conduct inspections .
he went deeply into enterprises and rural areas to understand the development situation , and listen to opinions and suggestions .
li peng pointed out : after more than 20 years of engaging in the reform and opening up , various localities throughout the country have made considerable progress of different degrees in terms of the economic level .
this is an issue concerned with by the party central committee and the people throughout the nation , and one of the important topics on the agenda of the upcoming third session of the ninth npc .
in jiangyang city 's huaxi village , li peng learned about the current economic development situation in this village , and talked cordially with the villagers at their homes .
it is necessary to continue consolidating agriculture 's place of being the basis , and seize favorable opportunities to accelerate the agricultural structural adjustment by closely centering around the issue of increasing peasants ' revenues .
li peng fully affirmed jiangsu 's achievements made in the recent years in such aspects as water conservancy , communications , other infrastructural constructions , environmental protection , and the building of spiritual civilization .
he said : the third session of the ninth npc is a great event of the political life in china at the turn of the century .
if a country 's sovereignty and territorial integrity are infringed upon or carved up , its fate will only be trampled upon at will by others and it will be bullied and humiliated by others .
this was the most heartfelt lesson for the chinese nation in modern history since the opium war .
jiang dianming pointed out : history has repeatedly proven that the stand of the cpc and the chinese government on adhering to the principle of one china will never change .
during that period , the chinese government repeatedly asked the united nations to change this illegitimate and unreasonable situation and restore the legitimate rights of prc in the united nations .
in recent years , lee teng - hui [ li teng - hui ] has constantly advocated " two chinas " and other fallacies and openly carried out splitting activities .
choosing " taiwan independence " means choosing war and undermining the principle of one china and will endanger the prospect of peaceful reunification .
we hope and believe the broad masses of compatriots in taiwan can see through the untruthful lies of politicians , who advocate " taiwan independence , " distinguish between right and wrong , and make their wise choice .
wei jianxing pointed out : the party central committee attaches great importance to making the " three stresses " education a success .
during his stay in jinzhou city , wei jianxing conducted an investigation and study on the work of improving the party style , building a clean and honest government and combating corruption .
wei jianxing held a discussion with the township ( town ) leading cadres of beining city and listened to their views on how to improve the party style and promote ethical integrity in the leading groups of township ( town ) party committees and among township ( town ) leading cadres .
generally speaking , the great majority of township ( town ) leading cadres are good , diligent , honest in performing official duties and working hard regardless of criticism ; and they have made important contributions to the development of the various rural undertakings .
for this reason , while we are focusing on improving the party style and the ethical integrity among the leading cadres at and above the county ( department ) level , we must also seriously solve the conspicuous problems existing among the grassroots cadres , particularly the township ( town ) leading cadres .
he called on the township ( town ) leading cadres to strictly exercise self - discipline , work diligently for the people , and make new contributions to building a new countryside .
during those inspection tours and meetings , he was accompanied separately by wen shizhen , secretary of the liaoning provincial party committee ; zhang guoguang , governor of liaoning province ; sun chunlan , deputy secretary of the provincial party committee ; and wang weizong and wang dongming , members of the standing committee of the provincial party committee .
beijing , 26 feb ( xinhua ) - - in answering a question raised by a reporter here today , foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao refuted the accusation on the human rights situation in china made in the 1999 " human rights report " by the us state department .
zhu bangzao answered : the chinese government has consistently respected the universal principles on human rights and actively worked to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedom of the people in line with the national conditions of china .
after long - term and unremitting efforts , the human rights and basic freedom enjoyed by the chinese people have been upgraded to an unprecedented historical level . this is a fact known to all .
to such an action of the united states , china expresses its strong displeasure and firm opposition [ qiang lie bu man he jian jue fan dui 1730 3525 0008 3341 0735 1017 0414 0646 1417 ] .
he then pointed out : shifang city has advanced in the van of the province in some work of economic and social development these years . in conducting the " three stresses " education , attention should be paid first to overcoming " complacency and then to persisting in setting high and strict demands on oneself .
it is necessary to use the experiences of provinces and ministries in carrying out " three stresses " education as reference and to work creatively according to the realities of the city .
while visiting the qingquan group in sichuan , an enterprise practicing the cooperative shares system , he learned of the beneficial results achieved by the enterprise by changing to the production of miscellaneous goods , such as curtain and clothes rods ; he gladly said : miscellaneous goods can also take over a big market .
at lingquan village under shifang city 's yuanshi town , hu jintao enthusiastically heard peasant li shugui 's briefing on how his family had become rich by raising chickens in a scientific way and spurred other people nearby to do the same .
hu jintao said to the cadres on the scene : this proves that when we help peasants enhance their awareness of the market , grasp and apply science and technology , and readjust the agricultural structure , they will be able to get into a position with broad prospects .
at chengdu 's pioneer garden set up by returned personnel who had studied abroad , hu jintao attentively acquainted himself with the situation in which such personnel had started undertakings ; he viewed the achievements on display and asked them what other assistance they still needed from the government .
he stressed once again : economic development cannot be made without science and technology , and new and high - tech industries cannot develop without talented people .
shortly before the end of his inspection , hu jintao heard the work briefings by the sichuan provincial cpc committee and the provincial government and made a speech .
the whole party should fully understand the economic and political as well as the immediate and long - term significance of this policy decision .
in conclusion , hu jintao pointed out : sichuan is now faced with a new situation and new opportunities in development , and leading bodies and leading cadres at various levels are also confronted with new , arduous tasks and rigorous tests .
we should profoundly grasp these remarks and conscientiously carry them out .
the standing committee has also examined the draft legislation law .
in line with the needs continuously emerged from the course of development of reform , opening up , and modernization drive , the npc and its standing committee revised laws with good timing , thus making the laws better fit into the objective reality and play a stronger role in setting up norms for social life .
the other characteristic of the legislative work of the npc standing committee in the past year was to bring the explanations of laws into the agenda of the standing committee meetings .
besides explaining the regulations related to the basic law of the hong kong special administrative region , the npc standing committee also examined the draft explanation related to the criminal law .
over the past year or so , the leading cadres above the navy 's division level presented more than 300 theses in connection with the topic research , of which all were exchanged at the cadre theoretical study classes or in the study of the central teams of the party committees .
the move to introduce theoretical study topics and genuinely integrate theory with practice has vigorously promoted nnvy building in an all - round way .
beijing , 27 february ( xinhua ) - - the eighth session of the standing committee of the national committee of the ninth chinese people 's political consultative conference (cppcc) has adopted a decision on revising parts of the constitution of the cppcc .
beijing , 27 february ( xinhua ) - - the eighth standing committee meeting of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] was held today in beijing .
li ruihuan , standing committee member of the central political bureau and chairman of the cppcc national committee , attended the meeting .
ye xuanping , vice chairman of the cppcc national committee , chaired the meeting this morning .
the meeting first approved the agenda of the standing committee meeting ; the decision on convening the third session of the ninth cppcc national committee ; the decision on revising the regulations of the cppcc national committee ; and the decision on resuming making a report on the motions work at the opening meeting of the cppcc plenary session .
before the meeting began , attendees of the meeting expressed profound condolences to hou jie , a standing committee member who passed away after the seventh standing committee .
i hope that all of you can conscientiously fulfill your duties , stick to principles , improve work systems , remain clean and self - disciplined , and work hard to fulfill the glorious tasks entrusted by the party central committee with a highly developed sense of political responsibility and mission .
wu bangguo noted : under the leadership of the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin at the core and thanks to the unremitting efforts of the whole party , the entire country , and the vast numbers of enterprise cadres and workers , the reform and development of state enterprises have attained remarkable results .
throughout the country , 26 provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities have attained better economic results than they did last year .
secondly , the " decision " of the fourth plenary session of the 15 th cpc central committee has further unified the thinking of the whole party .
we should constantly improve the work contents and the activity forms of party organizations in enterprises , and explore better ways and methods for giving play to their role as a political core .
the building of a sound party work style and a clean administration in state enterprises should be closely combined with the work of investigating and handling major and serious cases , and should run through all management systems of an enterprise .
strengthening the effective supervision of state enterprises and ensuring that the value of state assets is preserved and increased is a major content of the establishment of a modern enterprise system , and also a realistic issue that we are facing today .
the present year is the final year for the fulfillment of the three - year target for the reform and the difficulty - relief work of state enterprises , stressed wu bangguo .
the fulfillment of this target is the essential among essentials in this year 's economic work .
the key state enterprises directly under the control of the central authorities are the vanguards of state enterprises , and a major pillar of the state economy .
this is not just an economic issue , but a major political issue as well .
secondly , we should quicken the pace of structural readjustment and the restructuring of enterprises .
key state enterprises should take an active part in the large - scale development of the country 's western region , and make due contribution to the development of the western region .
third , we should take active steps to promote the building of a modern enterprise system .
it is important to standardize the policy - making procedure of enterprises , and enhance their level of making scientific policy decisions .
fourth , we should take earnest steps to ensure the stability of enterprises , and see to a successful fulfillment of the target of " two ensures . "
we should give full rein to the role of grass - roots party branches as a powerful fighting force , and to the exemplary vanguard role of party members .
leading cadres are required to set an example with their own conduct ; and take the initiative to show concern for , and to help resolve , the practical problems that are currently faced by workers living in straitened circumstances and by retired personnel .
wu bangguo also urged the cwce to work hard and turn itself into a work organ which is honest and diligent in performing its official duties , aims to attain tangible results with a high efficiency , and dares to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit ; and which is trusted by the central authorities and welcomed by enterprises .
public opinion generally maintained : it stands to reason that the white paper was released prior to taiwan 's general election , which will be held in mid - march this year .
encouraged by the united states , lee teng - hui [ li denghui ] dished up the " two - state theory " in support of " taiwan independence " in a flagrant way and in an attempt to separate taiwan from china forever .
following beijing 's fierce criticism , the " two - state theory , " however , finds it difficult to go anywhere in the international arena , and lee teng - hui was forced to slightly restrain his " overt independence " activities .
however , he still firmly upholds the " two - state theory . " one of lee teng - hui 's trusted followers once said with confidence that communist china will have no excuse to use force if we do not include the " two - state " theory in the constitution or declare " taiwan independence . "
under such circumstances , it is imperative for the chinese government to reiterate the " one - china " principle and the policy of " peaceful reunification , " to redefine the three prerequisites for using force for reunification , and to give a direct sharp warning to relevant figures in taiwan .
if one has a real understanding of the white paper , he should find that the theme of the white paper is still the " one china " principle and that beijing 's policy toward taiwan is still " peaceful reunification " and " one country , two systems . "
the central committees of eight democratic parties and the all - china association of industry and commerce made 63 proposals , and subcommittees put forward 26 .
as of 20 february 2000 , 3,004 proposals had been handled , and replies given to their respective sponsors , accounting for 96.3 percent of the total number of proposals made .
according to briefings , under the leadership of the standing committee of the cppcc national committee , various special committees have given priority to studying and investigating actual conditions and setting forth their views with the focus on the central tasks and striven to raise the level of their research on special topics .
besides , the cultural and historical data committee and the foreign affairs committee have also done a lot of work within the limits of their functions .
the main tasks include beautifying the living environment , maintaining public order , enriching people 's cultural and sports life , disseminating scientific knowledge , promoting community service , and cementing closer interpersonal ties .
liu yunshan emphasized the need to grasp two key points in work . the first task is to develop community services .
efforts should be made to extensively launch a rich variety of cultural and sports activities and promotions of scientific knowledge that are convenient to the masses . the people should be guided to make conscious efforts to change their old customs and habits and foster healthy and civilized habits .
liu yunshan emphasized the need to do a good job in building three contingents .
in the building of these contingents , special attention should be paid to bringing into play the role of retired party members , cadres , teachers and workers as well as old labor models in conducting ideological education .
garrison units should be encouraged to share their cultural and sports grounds and facilities with members of the public while stepping up the building of community facilities .
third , persistence in making joint efforts to grasp problems and exercise management .
the role of relevant functional departments should be brought into full play and the enthusiasm of all quarters should be aroused in order to produce a combined force through their coordination and cooperation .
fourth , increased media publicity .
efforts should be made to promptly report on the progress of activities , introduce advanced experience , and increase the intensity of media supervision .
hu zhenmin , deputy director of the general office of the central guidance committee of spiritual civilization construction , chaired the conference .
it goes without saying that in this wide , wide world , every country has its particular problems and circumstances . if the united states wants to publish a " human rights report , " it should do so about its own domestic conditions .
what is strange about the us " human rights report " is that it is preceded by the word " global . " in other words , the united states wants to judge and criticize the human rights conditions of every other country in the world and even lecture and chide a given country for its human rights conditions .
more importantly , all those accusations by the us state department are pure fabrications and pure nonsense . on no account do they reflect hong kong 's real situation , where human rights and rule of law have been well protected since its reversion . those accusations can only show americans ' blind arrogance and ignorance .
and , the first spring of the new millennium was especially warm and invigorating to shenzhen 's high - and new - technology industries .
the general secretary 's caring attitude , sincere teachings , and warm encouragement greatly encouraged and stimulated shenzhen and shenzhen 's high - and new - technology industries .
several thousand zhongxing employees were expecting an important guest .
with smiles on his face , general secretary jiang cordially said to the microphone : " how are you , comrades !
the accompanying mayor of shenzhen , li zibin , mentioned : " this came from the company headquarters 20 km away . "
upon learning this , general secretary jiang nodded his head to show his appreciation .
after inquiring about the enterprise 's operation and management in a detailed manner , general secretary jiang expressed his support for the company 's proposal to conduct stock futures pilot projects within the enterprise .
there is , hou weigui reported , fierce competition for qualified personnel , the principal resource for a high - tech enterprise , without which we would have nothing , and consequently the greatest challenge presented by china 's joining of the wto to us will be competition for qualified personnel .
on his way to inspection spots , general secretary jiang mentioned to accompanying leaders that those engaged in processing and assembling were also working in high - tech areas and should , according to personnel requirements different from the past , also be " high - tech " workers .
in front of the zhongxing communications company 's mobile communication stall , general secretary jiang picked up a zhongxing 189 dual - band mobile telephone characterized by autonomous intellectual property rights ; he examined the telephone carefully and inquired about its performance and structure in a detailed manner .
general secretary jiang said : " as the development of mobile telephones is rather rapid , it is necessary to master core technologies such as chip technology as soon as possible . "
arriving at the integrated circuit stall , general secretary jiang picked up a special 0.35 - millimeter integrated circuit chip developed by the company independently , carefully examined the chip , and inquired about its sale and prices on markets at home and abroad in a detailed manner .
president hou weigui of the company said : " the cost of producing a sdh single board on the basis of using the chip developed by ourselves is less than $ 100 , but the cost will reach more than $ 2,000 if an imported chip is used .
by mastering the development and designing of chips , we will be able to cut costs significantly . "
this machine of yours , general secretary jiang said very happily , is a robot , and it is wonderful that you have been able to export automated equipment designed by yourselves .
at the huawei technology company , ltd. , base in tian , general secretary jiang excitedly viewed a modernized production line based on equipment characterized by autonomous intellectual property rights .
chairman zeng peiyan of the state planning commission mentioned that our country was now proceeding with the transformation of rural power grids .
after entering into the modern electronic home office demonstration area , general secretary jiang happily invited accompanying provincial and municipal leaders to sit down .
the company 's sales , wang zhirong reported , totaled less than 200 million yuan in 1988 but reached 700 million yuan in 1994 , and now the company 's assets total 3.66 billion yuan rmb , with last year 's sales revenues and net profits representing increases of 430 percent and 590 percent , respectively , over 1994 .
the growth of kaifa science and technology illustrated the development of shenzhen 's high - and new - technology industries in microcosm .
at zhongxing communications , hou weigui reported to the general secretary on the company 's ownership reform , operational and management reform , and internationalization development since the company 's inception in a detailed manner .
at 9:10 am on the 22 nd , general secretary jiang came to the taiwan - invested fushikang enterprise group at longhua township , baoan district . he made a drive - through inspection of the fushikang 21 st - century information science , technology , and industry park which occupied 106 square km of land .
general secretary jiang was very happy to see flowers everywhere , large numbers of trees , the orderly production areas , and the quiet and comfortable living areas in the park .
he encouraged fushikang to further expand the investment in shenzhen . if there is an investment project and plan , it is necessary to diligently pursue implementation , he said .
but the propaganda department has warned some of these providers for carrying foreign media reports .
the authorities said that it relayed last year some reports from the media in hong kong , taiwan , and overseas .
the reports were reprinted or relayed by more than 10 traditional media outlets and websites in the mainland , thus causing a negative social impacts .
internet chinese hotmail told this newspaper that it has never received from the government 's press administration any documents concerning internet news regulations .
it was learned that the press and publications administration recently published the names of more than 10 publications that had been suspended for deviating public opinion orientation and other reasons .
how should we gain a correct understanding of the issue ?
how can we reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls ? 1 .
the pros and cons and gains and losses in wto accession joining the wto is an inherent demand of deepening the reforms , expanding our opening up to the world , and building socialist market economy in china , and the demand of our economic development .
after joining the wto , china must carry out its obligations under wto rules and gradually open its domestic market ; this will further improve the investment environment for foreign companies and strengthen the attraction of our market for those companies , and this will help to bring in more foreign capital , technology , and management experience .
it will benefit the effort to speed up our industrial restructuring and optimization .
wto accession will create a favorable international environment for carrying out this strategic task .
it will benefit us in continuing to deepen the reforms of china 's economic setup .
the goal of reforming our economic setup is to build a socialist market economy setup , and its basic demand is to fully exploit the market competition mechanism .
it will benefit china in participating in the process of economic globalization .
in order to suit the new situation of economic globalization , we need to seek the guarantee of a stable , transparent , and predictable multilateral trade mechanism , so that we can do still better at reaping the benefits and avoiding the pitfalls and protect and strengthen ourselves in the process of economic globalization .
in joining the wto , china and the other members must strictly act in accordance with the international rules and mutually open up the markets .
this will benefit china in fully participating in international competition and cooperation and in fully exploiting our relative strong points .
at the same time , joining the wto will also benefit china in engaging in broad cooperation with multinational companies , in importing their funds , technology , and management experience , and in using their sales channels and networks to expand our exports .
of course , in joining the wto , we will both enjoy the legitimate rights and also undertake corresponding obligations , which will inevitably pose a certain degree of pressure and challenge for us .
first of all , further opening up markets will cause certain products , enterprises , and industries to face intense competition .
in opening up our market in the past , china made its own decisions on permitting market entry , reducing tariffs , and abolishing nontariff measures in accordance with the demands of economic development and the process of economic system reforms .
third , the adjudication in resolving multilateral disputes may have unfavorable consequences for us .
take a dialectical view of the pros and cons and gains and losses how should we view the pros and cons and gains and losses in china 's wto accession ?
we must view this problem in an all - round , developmental , and dialectical way ; we must stand at the overall and strategic level of reform , opening up , economic development , and modernization to analyze the pros and cons and gains and losses of china 's wto accession .
we must look at single industries and the whole of industry ; we must look at the present and also at the long term .
in analyzing the pros and cons and gains and losses of china 's wto accession , we cannot just look at one or a few industries but should focus on our entire economic development .
wto accession , however , will also hit and pressurize some domestic industries to a certain extent , such as grain in agriculture , the automobile industry , and banking and insurance in the service trades ; all these will face competition pressure from the developed countries .
from the angle of industry as a whole , wto accession will bring china 's industry more opportunities than blows , and the majority of our industries will gain more development opportunities .
wto accession is not only of positive significance for economic growth in the short term but will also have a far - reaching impact on economic development in the long term .
we must also take a dialectical view of the pros and cons and gains and losses in joining the wto .
meet the challenges , promote the prose and eliminate the cons wto accession is both an opportunity and a challenge for china , and we must seize the opportunity and meet the challenge .
we must unify our thinking , take precautions against a rainy day , work hard , and do a good job of making full preparations in all respects .
enhance understanding and unify thinking .
wto accession is a major event in the process of china 's reform , opening up , and modernization , which will have a far - reaching impact on our economic development in the new century .
all levels in the country , especially the cadres at all levels , must fully understand the strategic significance of joining the wto , and be mentally prepared for the pressure and challenges that it may bring .
all trades and sectors must study and propose targeted and practical measures in light of the wto demands and our commitments , so as to meet the wto pressure and challenges .
in accordance with the provisions of the wto " accord on agricultural produce , " we should rationally protect our domestic agricultural production and guard against and lighten the blows from agricultural imports .
we must speed up the establishment of a complete agricultural produce quality standards setup , perfect the plant and animal disease prevention standards , and strengthen the monitoring and inspection of diseases in china and abroad .
we must deepen the enterprise reforms , and build an enterprise management system and operational mechanism that meet the demands of socialist market economy , so that the enterprises will become legal entities and main players in market competition , making their own decisions on operations and taking responsibility for their own profit and loss .
we should speed up the strategic reorganization of the enterprises , form a rational economic scale , and develop a number of powerful large enterprises and consortia .
we must strengthen management , adopt modern management technique , methods , and measures , and strengthen production cost , fund , and quality controls .
at the same time , we must make rational use of the trade remedial measures permitted by the wto , such as emergency import guarantee measures and antidumping measures , to ensure the healthy and steady development of industries related to china 's economic security and major interests .
at the same time , in accordance with chinese law , we must strictly enforce the examination and approval system and strengthen supervision and control of the service trades .
fourth , strengthen the control of cultural products .
at the same time , we must strictly enforce examination and approval of the import of foreign cultural products , to prevent the intrusion of unhealthy culture .
many of the contents of the wto behavior regulations and its operational mechanisms are new to us , and we can only meet the wto 's demands by changing our concepts and mechanisms .
governing the country according to law is the basic principle for the party in leading the people to govern the country .
we must ensure that there are laws to follow , that those who violate them are prosecuted , and that laws are strictly enforced , and comprehensively raise the level of law enforcement .
at the same time we must vigorously train domestic enterprise managers , to ensure that they will become familiar with international trade regulations as soon as possible and enhance their ability to develop the international market .
observers point out : the essential difference between the readjustment to be made now and that in the past lies in the fact that a market - oriented strategy for the current readjustment has been clearly set forth .
meanwhile , people who generally live a relatively comfortable life are no longer satisfied only with enough to eat and enough to wear , and they now make higher demands on the quality of agricultural products .
as china 's accession to the world trade organization [ wto ] is approaching , china has for the first time felt the pressure of the international market agriculturally .
to solve the problem of surplus labor in rural areas , the government advocates making vigorous efforts to develop village and town enterprises as well as small cities and towns .
economists believe that this is conducive not only to the diversion of rural surplus labor and an increase in peasants ' incomes but also to bringing about the growth of demand for investment and consumption and promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .
experts forecast that china 's population will increase to 1.6 billion in the next 30 years and that it will need to increase its grain production by 30 percent if per capital annual consumption of grain is 400 kilograms .
therefore , the chinese government has required all localities to do everything possible to maintain their grain - producing ability in order to meet any possible emergency when necessary .
beijing , 28 feb ( xinhua ) - - to rapidly and correctly investigate cases of dereliction of duty , we need the vigorous cooperation and close coordination of all departments concerned .
some producers of audio - visual products can hardly subsist by merely counting on their main business , and markets selling non - pirated audio - visual products are withering .
that was a statement made by minister of culture sun jiazheng at the 14 th session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee today [ 28 february ] .
in view of the problems in the chinese markets of cultural goods , the npc standing committee met today to hear a special report prepared by the ministry of culture on the management of the markets of cultural goods .
sun jiazheng said : pirated audio - visual products come primarily from three sources : 1 ) they are smuggled into the country from the outside .
2 ) second , they are produced by the underground producers at home .
3 ) they are products produced by legitimate producers that have succumbed to the onslaught of pirated products and to the temptation of high profits .
sun jiazheng analyzed : the main causes of the chinese markets being replete with pirated audio - visual products are as follows : - - consumers ' growing needs and the inadequate supply of legitimate products have created an enormous capacity for pirated audio - visual products .
some consumers buy pirated goods because they are inexpensive . it is hard for them to reject pirated goods voluntarily .
this being the case , it is difficult to create a force that can eliminate pirated audio - visual products from all sides .
- - inefficient management and difficulty in enforcing the law .
with respect to management , it is still multilateral , especially in local areas .
different departments have different policies , which crisscross with each other laterally and vertically . in actual operations , certain illegal elements , harbored by administrators , are not punished . some administrators , under constant retaliation and threat , dare not handle the problem seriously .
all relevant departments - - the ministry of culture , the ministry of public security , the state administration of industry and commerce , the state press and publications administration , the national working group for wiping out pornography and pirated goods - - must work to address the problem together .
we must energetically compress and consolidate the areas that sell audio - visual products , and strictly crack down on unlicensed stalls and roving sellers .
the ministry of culture issued a notice in march 1999 on compressing and consolidating the nation 's 162 sites , each had at least 10 stores that sold audio - visual products . efforts are being made to cut the number in half by the end of this year . 3 .
we must continue to improve all administrative measures , streamline the administrative system , and tighten day - to - day market controls . 5 .
a sound coordination is required as concerns the concrete work arrangements of the supervision .
at the same time , they stressed the need to have a proper understanding of problems exposed in the customs ranks and to promote clean administration and combat corruption in a deepgoing manner .
in this connection , these reporters interviewed qian guanlin , director of the general administration of customs [ gac ] .
qian guanlin gave us a brief introduction to the development of the customs ranks since the national anti - smuggling work conference in july 1998 .
the customs departments will comprehensively strengthen the development of the customs ranks by laying stress on the arrangement of three anti - corruption work as determined by the central authorities .
first , to " put the customs under strict administration , " we must start with putting the officials under strict administration and strengthening the administration of and supervision over leading cadres .
second , we will center on the proper handling of our relationship with the objects of our work to conduct deepgoing education and rectification and conscientiously check unhealthy tendencies in the profession .
such malpractices will be strictly dealt with as soon as detected and there shall be absolutely no leeway for " offsetting faults against merits " or " giving the offender a second chance . "
anyone found violating the " rules for clean administration by the customs " shall be severely punished in accordance with the maximum penalty .
at the same time , he pointed out , the main problems facing china 's economy were the problems of insufficient social demand and supply , conspicuous contradictions in the irrational economic structure , slowing down in the growth of farmers ' income , and increasing pressure on labor employment .
the quality of economic operation has further improved .
the volume of losses suffered by loss - making industrial enterprises with a certain operation scale dropped by 15.2 percent .
overall investment in fixed assets has continued to maintain a growth momentum .
in 1999 social investment in fixed assets increased by 5.2 percent from the previous year , of which investment in the state - owned economy and other types of economic sectors was up 6.1 percent .
in foreign trade , the export sector has picked up .
in 1999 , total volume of exports amounted to $ 194.9 billion , up 6.1 percent from the previous or a noticeably better improvement than expected at the beginning of the year .
in the first half of 1999 , market sales were relatively dull .
total sales volume of social consumer goods throughout the year increased by 6.8 percent from the previous year , of which the increased figure in the last quarter alone was 8 percent .
although the growth rate in 1999 as a whole could not be considered high , the market had begun to show a level of activism in dynamic terms .
particularly the successful experimental flight of the " shenzhou " spaceship marked that china 's manned spaceflight cause had made an important step .
the " regulations " consist of 13 chapters with 92 articles .
the " regulations " point out : education programs run by army academies and schools are an important component part of the state 's education undertaking , and the basic means for the training of military professionals .
these " regulations " took effect on the day of promulgation .
the status of water resources has been a key factor restricting western development .
the west particularly northwest china is rich in land resources , but plagued by fragile ecological environment such as the scarcity of water resources and worsening and soil erosion problems .
therefore , water resources are the resources with most strategic significance of this region and their optimal development and utilization is significant in carrying out western development strategy .
fourthly , proceeding from a long - term point of view and consideration of overall situation , carry out cross - region and cross - valley water transfer . these four aspects come to a conclusion of handling well optimal allocation of water resources and making effort in improving level of scientific utilization of water resources .
due to unawareness of effective allocation and scientific utilization of water resources , ecological environment was destroyed by good intentions in making wrong things , from which a lesson must be drawn in the development of water resources in western china .
unrealistic enlargement of irrigation area of talimu ( tarim ) water upstream has caused excessive use of water , made the river shorten for several hundred kilometers , caused almost one - third of poplars to die , and worsened desertification on the lower reaches of the river , wang shucheng said .
the ascension of the groundwater level of the upstream has also caused salinization or alkalinization of soil .
some similar examples can be found in western china .
every province , municipality , and region will be allocated certain projects in line with special emphasis on local condition .
beijing , 28 feb ( xinhua ) - - this afternoon , lt. gen. xiong guangkai , deputy chief of general staff of the chinese people 's liberation army [ pla ] , met here with adm. dennis blair , commander - in - chief of the pacific command of the us armed forces .
prior to this , vice adm. shi yunsheng , commander of the navy , met with blair and his delegation .
blair 's delegation arrived in beijing yesterday afternoon for a visit at the invitation of the chinese pla general staff department .
afterward , the vice presidents signed such responsibility letters with the top leaders of the courts , departments , bureaus , and offices under their jurisdiction .
meanwhile , disciplinary penalties should be imposed on those leaders who seriously practice bureaucracy , who neglect the duty of supervising personnel , and who are directly responsible for poor management .
lax discipline and the failure to make the enforcement of laws known to the public are major enemies affecting the construction of the contingent of cadres . only by so doing will leading cadres not lag behind others and be ever victorious in the course of advancement .
under strict management and strict supervision , we will be able to forcefully carry forward justice , to vigorously check unhealthy trends , and to completely change the mental outlook of the contingent of judges .
it has been learned that , in the speech , jiang zemin again reiterated the following important principles : - - he stressed holding cross - strait talks on an equal basis under the one - china principle and did not mention " talks between the central and local authorities . "
- - after reunification , taiwan does not need to be subjected to the cpc 's leadership , and the cpc will not develop its organizations in taiwan .
the white paper fully shows the sense of urgency and mission china has in resolving the taiwan issue .
on no account must china allow the " taiwan independence " forces to do whatever they like on the island .
if the one - china principle is scrapped and taiwan is even separated from china in whatever means and with whatever forms , this will lead the two sides of the strait to the abyss of war .
this us strategy serves its global strategy designed to control the european and asian continents , prevent the rise of powers that can sit as equals at the same table with the us , and safeguard its global hegemony .
hence , with this hegemonist strategy and desire , the us views the increasingly powerful china as a major hidden strategic opponent .
the actions taken by the us and japan may possibly spark a confrontation between big powers in east asia and will thus endanger peace in the asia - pacific region and the world at large .
after the us department of defense issued a report on military strength in the taiwan strait at the beginning of last year , the us has noticeably increased arms sales to taiwan with a clearer objective in mind and intensified technical upgrades of weapons sold to taiwan .
it has not only improved the after - sale service of the f-16 fighters but also insisted on selling early warning systems to taiwan in disregard of china 's strong opposition . moreover , it considered selling and transferring aegis destroyers , " patriot " - iii missiles and technologies relating to the tmd [ theatrical missile defense ] .
the chinese government has never compromised in the slightest degree on the major issue of the principle of safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and china means what it says in this regard .
to safeguard national security and achieve the motherland 's reunification , china must speed up the pace of national defense modernization and continuously enhance its military strength .
the purpose for china to strengthen its military strength is for self - defense . this is conducive to peace and stability in the asia - pacific region and peace in the world .
gdp rose by 7.1 percent , which exceeded the expectations at the beginning of the year .
foreign exchange reserves totaled $ 154.7 billion , and tax revenue broke through 1 trillion yuan ; both figures were records .
national people 's congress [ npc ] deputy yao zhenyan said that expanding domestic demand and practicing a positive fiscal policy and corresponding monetary policy have played a key role in these achievements .
this happened to be the year of the 50 th anniversary of the founding of the prc and the reversion of macao , and we were also facing imminent entry to the wto , thus further embroiling us in the opportunities and challenges of world economy .
at that time , the stock market , termed the barometer of the national economy , was sagging .
in 1998 the newly issued state bonds were mainly used in infrastructure construction , but in 1999 some of them were used as discount payments on enterprise technology loans , to encourage the enterprises to update their technology and plant and increase hi - tech input .
according to calculations , 9 billion worth of fiscal discounting can draw forth about 180 billion worth of investment in technical improvements .
third , in developing the economy , we have persisted in adopting the guideline of expanding domestic demand , and there is no contradiction between this and expanding our opening up to the world and fully exploiting both domestic and foreign markets and resources .
the tax rebate on exports was raised in january and again in july , with the result that the overall rebate rate on export commodities exceeded 15 percent ; the progress of rebate was also speeded up , and a total of 62.5 billion yuan in rebate was dealt with .
in april the ministry of finance readjusted the policy regarding tax on imported plant , thus appropriately increasing imports , while in addition the customs cracked down hard on smuggling , with the result that the strategy of spurring exports and market diversification through imports achieved its predicted results .
by the end of 1999 , the slide in china 's exports had halted and they were rising ; the increase was 6 percent over the 1998 figure ; this made a valuable contribution to increasing foreign exchange reserves , maintaining the stability of the renminbi , and leading forward economic growth over the whole year .
some of the deputies gave this evaluation : " with no duplicate construction , we have done things that we wanted to do for many years . "
xie ping , a deputy to the ninth npc and director of the research bureau of the people 's bank of china , said that practice has proven that the orientation of the state bond investment set by the central authorities is correct .
the merit is here now , and the benefits will be long term .
there was a decline of 84 percent in relatively big danger spots and 90 percent in dangerous gushers .
he said that the effects of building water conservancy products and taming the river and the lakes are evident .
such a change results from the large - scale project to improve the rural power grids which started in the second half of 1998 .
in 1999 china 's economy tasted to the full the vexations of surplus production , and advanced toward new life amid gradual restructuring and technical improvement .
the sown areas of grain , cotton , and sugar crops were reduced in 1999 , since the storehouses were " bursting at the seams " or else there were stockpiles of these crops , and their respective output declined by 1 , 11 , and 10 percent compared with the previous year .
some peasants learned the lesson of " increasing output without increasing income , " and no longer blindly pursued quantity ; instead , they paid attention to market changes , improvement of varieties , and science and technology input , and there was no lack of people whose returns steadily increased as a result .
at the same time , spurred by market forces and supported by bank loans , a number of new - style domestic electrical appliances , computers , mobile phones and so on , with high science and technology content , low energy consumption , and a variety of functions rapidly sprang up , thus further improving market supply .
the rate of decline of the price level , which has been in negative growth for more than 20 successive months , has gradually lessened as domestic demand is stimulated , and the categories of commodities whose prices are rising is now increasing .
we believe that so long as we stick to the guideline of expanding domestic demand and practice a positive fiscal policy , china 's economy will certainly be able to enter a virtuous circle as the international economy takes a turn for the better , policies are perfected , reforms are deepened , and systems are replaced .
formulating , amending , and interpreting laws - - legislation more mature , of better quality by the day the formulation of our law on legislation has attracted world attention over the past year .
china has speeded up its legislative work in recent years .
following two examinations and discussions by the national people 's congress [ npc } standing committee , the draft of the law on legislation will be submitted to the third session of the ninth npc for examination and discussion .
more than quantity , legislation requires quality .
her request was supported by the state general administration for environmental protection .
ms. yao 's experience has proven one fact : the law must ensure that the administrative organs carry out their duties according to law , and also prevent abuse of administrative powers and protect citizens ' rights and interests .
ms. yao 's appeal has also proven a fact : only by carrying out administration according to law can functions be correctly exercised and can the masses ' support and cooperation be gained .
prior to the law on administrative review , administrative powers were constrained by a series of laws such as the law on administrative procedure , the law on state compensation , and the law on administrative punishment .
speaking of carrying out administration according to law , some deputies and committee members held : " for the government at all levels , administering according to law is the inevitable demand and the best choice . "
intensify supervision , improve supervision methods , perfect supervision procedure - - supervision yields practical results intensifying supervision has consistently been an issue of concern to the masses .
after the second session of the ninth npc , standing committee chairman li peng pointed out : assign supervisory work a position of equal importance with legislative work , further intensify supervision , improve supervision methods , perfect the supervision procedure , and attach importance to practical results .
to formulate a law on supervision has been the common call of deputies and committee members in recent years .
the villagers of bailian village of pandai township of this city were unhappy over the vagueness of the village 's financial accounts , and a meeting of over 600 villagers was held which lawfully dismissed village committee head he guangshou from his post .
ma xianzhang , a npc deputy and vice chairman of the henan provincial people 's congress , said : " nine hundred million of the 1.2 billion people of china live in the rural areas ; this is china 's basic national condition .
we must attach importance to mobilizing the masses ' initiative and creativity in the process of strengthening the building of grassroots democracy and the legal system . "
the revised organic law on village committees sets down in the form of law the " four democracies , " that is , democratic elections , decisionmaking , management , and supervision ; apart from giving the villagers the enthusiasm to exercise their democratic rights , it has also given them the legal right to exercise democratic management .
we are informed that making village affairs public and democratic management have been implemented throughout the country since last year .
when the court makes a judgement , it should be enforced , otherwise , where is the fairness ? "
according to statistics , from january to october last year , courts throughout the country completed the enforcement of judgments in 1.65 million cases , 31 percent more than in the corresponding period of 1998 ; the price tag for those involved was 143.7 billion yuan .
on 10 july 1986 , qian jiadong , ambassador of china 's permanent delegation to the united nations in geneva , presented a note to gatt director - general arthur denker , officially applying for china 's return to gatt ( known as wto after 1995 ) as a signatory power .
after 1989 , as the western countries headed by the united states made unrealistic demands on china , sino - us negotiations on china 's return to gatt hit a standstill .
an analysis by experts here stated that china 's " entry into wto " has quickened since last year and this is the outcome of a strategic decision made by the hierarchy of the chinese government by judging the hour and sizing up the situation .
just as an article published recently by " renmin ribao " stated , quickening china 's " entry into wto " negotiations and enabling china to accede to wto on an earlier date is at once a natural choice for china in developing a socialist market economy and a need for china in furthering her reform and opening up .
therefore , the bilateral agreement reached between china and the united states has removed the biggest obstacle on the road leading to china 's " entry into wto . "
as a matter of fact , china 's earlier accession to wto will benefit not just china but also the countries the world over , wto , and the global economic development .
just as wto director - general mackell muir pointed out during an interview with reporters in beijing the other day : without china 's participation , wto would be a semi - world trade organization . only after china becomes its member will wto turn into a real world trade organization .
the day china accedes to wto will be a historical event and a great day for china and the world .
some symposiums or study classes on the theme of china 's entry into wto have also been welcomed by the public at large .
an analysis by some experts stated that as the day china accedes to wto is drawing near day by day , the issues concerning " entry into wto " are likely to be major topics of concern for discussion at this year 's forthcoming " two sessions . "
during the era of deng xiaoping and chiang ching - kuo , in particular , cross - strait relations were moving in the direction of relaxed and steady development .
jiang zemin , the leader of the third generation of the chinese government , has all the more spared no effort in pushing forward the great reunification cause of the motherland .
this has been the most relaxed atmosphere and the most sincere benevolence ever offered by the cpc to the kmt , and by mainland compatriots to taiwan compatriots , since the founding of new china .
however , lee teng - hui , head of those in power in taiwan , has acted in a diametrically opposite way , and has gradually taken the separatist road of " taiwan independence . "
based on the moral principles of mankind and in line with international law , a country has the power , the responsibility , and the obligation to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and to realize its unification .
in this aspect , the chinese people enjoy a glorious tradition and have a sincere love for their own motherland ; and they will never allow themselves to be bullied by foreign invaders , or tolerate the loss of even one inch of the sacred land of their country .
as early as 1950 , with the aim of guarding our home and protecting our people , we carried out the great patriotic and international struggle of resisting us aggression and aiding korea , and successfully defeated us aggressors in the end .
in 1969 , we launched a counterattack against the then vietnam in self - defense , and successfully guarded our frontier .
it is beyond any doubt or reproach that all these were patriotic and just moves aimed at protecting and safeguarding china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
if the taiwan authorities indefinitely refuse a peaceful settlement of cross - strait reunification through negotiations , which is the third scenario pointed out in the white paper , the chinese government will be forced to settle the issue by use of force .
adhering to the one - china principle is the basis and prerequisite for cross - strait negotiations .
in addition to this , this year is the last year for china to fulfill the ninth five - year plan and important objectives for the end of this century , an important year for chinese people to make preparations for attaining the great rejuvenation of the nation in the new century .
major items on the agenda of the " two sessions " this year 's " two sessions " will have the same characteristic of a short duration as last year 's .
the third session of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] will be held from 5 to 15 march , the same as last year .
the third session of the ninth national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] will be held from 3 to 11 march , a period two days shorter than last year 's .
li peng to give work report personally what merits attention is that the past practice of having a npc standing committee vice chairman deliver the standing committee work report will be changed this year , and chairman li peng will give the standing committee work report personally .
judging from the npc history , when liu shaoqi was the chairman of the first npc standing committee , the standing committee work report was distributed in written form directly to deputies instead of being read by the chairman .
that li peng delivers the standing committee work report is conducive for the npc to open up a new situation in the new century , to make its work more transparent , and to gear its work more to the needs of the society and the public .
in addition , the press center of the " two sessions " will also make arrangements for local provincial and municipal leaders to be interviewed collectively by chinese and foreign reporters .
it plays the role of the " head " and carries out important functions in commanding troops in fighting and in the construction of troops . at the entire military chief of staff conference , president jiang pointed out the profound truth that currently great changes are taking place in the world 's militaries .
especially in the field of commanding wars , the changes are larger than ever . handling information takes much less time than it did previously . the commanding of strategies , campaigns and tactics are all merged . the efficiency and working quality of commanding units have a decisive influence on the outcome of wars .
this theme will promote new developments in the campaign of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun and is significant .
during the spring 37 years ago , president mao zedong wrote a few words of commendation himself , calling on from comrade lei feng .
old - generation revolutionaries , including liu shaoqi , zhou enlai , zhu de , deng xiaoping and chen yun , also wrote words of commendation to highly praise the lei feng spirit .
the whole party , entire military and the people of the whole country warmly responded , and a mass campaign of learning from lei feng burgeoned rapidly in china .
we must educate and direct the young rank and file to strengthen their revolutionary beliefs like lei feng and li xiangqun did .
if we implement this principle in the campaigns of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun , we must arouse and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of the young rank and file to the utmost extent and let them maintain high enthusiasm in their training .
we must educate the young rank and file to do as lei feng and li xiangqun did , assiduously research military technology , skillfully master their weapons , master strong skills for wars , and achieve a perfect combination of people and weapons .
we must effectively carry out the campaigns of learning from lei feng and li xiangqun into the new century .
if one were to abandon the one - china principle and even try by various means to seek different forms of independence with the aim of separation , however , it would only draw the two sides of the strait to the abyss of a war .
in recent years , the separatist forces in taiwan represented by lee teng - hui ( li denghui ) have turned a deaf ear to the solemn warnings of the chinese government , wantonly carrying out , under various political pretences , separatist activities in a bid to create independence .
theoretically , they gradually have deviated from the one - china principle , trumpeting " two governments , " " two reciprocal political entities , " and " taiwan is already a state with independent sovereignty . " they connive at and provide support for the separatists who advocate " taiwan independence " and their activities .
there is only one china in the world ; taiwan is part of the chinese territory ; and china 's territory and sovereignty must not be separated .
persisting in " taiwan independence " means war between the two sides of the strait .
in the major event that taiwan is separated from china under whatever name , we shall be duty - bound to take drastic measures , including the use of force , to defend china 's sovereignty and territorial integrity .
also precisely because of this , us policymakers have in recent times been forced to recognize that avoiding the reoccurrence of conflicts and confrontation in the taiwan strait and the unsettling of the foundation of sino - us relations is a prudent choice and is in its best strategic interests .
large amounts of fact have demonstrated that even though the united states has affirmed and reaffirmed its " one china " position all these years , the anti - china forces in the united states have in practice consistently treated taiwan as a political entity , pledging to " improve relations with taiwan . "
even as the taiwan relations act continues to cast a dark shadow on sino - us relations , the anti - china forces in the us congress are now clamoring to pass the taiwan security enhancement act .
not only is it flagrant interference in china 's internal affairs and a serious threat to china 's security as it obstructs china 's peaceful reunification process , it is also endangering peace and stability in the asia - pacific region and the world as a whole .
of the above mentioned " three ifs , " it is fully reasonable regard foreign interference as one of the major obstacles to the peaceful settlement of the taiwan question .
incomplete statistics showed that in the 1950 - 1987 period , the contract value of the us arms sales to taiwan reached almost $ 6.4 billion . however , in a 10 - year period between 1988 and 1997 , it rose to as high as $ 11.38 billion .
in february of this year , noisily advocated by some anti - china congressmen , the us house of representatives flagrantly passed a bill called " taiwan security enhancement law " and tried to turn it into a binding document in the form of law .
the anti - china forces in the united states are not only the root cause of the taiwan question but also a major external factor for delaying the settlement of the taiwan question for a long time .
settling the taiwan question and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland as early as possible is where the fundamental interests of the whole chinese people , including the taiwan people , lie and is beneficial to the sino - us relations development for a long time to come .
he reiterated his government 's stance of sticking to the " one - china " policy .
he said the white paper " the one - china principle and the taiwan issue " manifested the chinese government 's consistent stand on the taiwan issue and reflected all chinese people 's aspiration . the great cause of china 's reunification is irresistible .
blair and his entourage is the first high - level us military delegation to visit china officially since us - led nato bombed the chinese embassy in the federal republic of yugoslavia in may 1999 .
chi haotian urged the united states to handle the taiwan issue appropriately by strictly adhering to the principles and relevant commitments established in the three sino - us joint communiques , stop arms sales to taiwan , and do things that truly promote the great cause of china 's reunification .
he also stressed that china has all along been pursuing a foreign policy of peace and independence and advocating resolving differences among countries peacefully through consultations and dialogue on an equal footing .
the united states upholds the principle of one china .
beijing , 29 feb (zxs) - - with an expanding population and a rapid economic and social development , shortage of water resources has become increasingly severe in china , which is an enormous threat to china 's future sustainable development .
during ordinary years , the amount of water shortage in irrigated areas across the country is 30 billion cubic meters per year and in urban areas is 6 billion cubic meters .
the total amount of waste water produced each year is nearly 60 billion tonnes , 80 percent of which was discharged directly into water areas without being processed .
investigation and evaluation of china 's more than 700 key rivers shows that nearly 50 percent of river stretches and more than 90 percent of urban riverside water areas are polluted .
politburo member and vice premier qian qichen addressed the meeting , noting that : that the taiwan problem cannot go unsolved indefinitely , is the consistent chinese position , nothing new .
the white paper that we issued recently on the one - china principle aroused widespread attention internationally , bringing a zealous response from the masses of overseas chinese .
after the white paper was issued , certain foreign media held that china 's policy on solving the taiwan problem had changed sharply , which is not so .
as to the fact that the taiwan problem cannot go unsolved indefinitely , that is also the consistent chinese position , nothing new .
qian qichen said that : as long ago as october 1984 , comrade deng xiaoping noted clearly in a speech that : " while we insist on pursuing a peaceful solution of the taiwan problem , we will never renounce the possibility of a non - peaceful solution , which commitment we cannot make .
how could we renounce national reunification ? "
qian qichen said that : we issued the white paper on " the one - china principle and the taiwan problem , " noting that the taiwan problem cannot go unsolved indefinitely , precisely to promote the development of cross - strait relations , to spur the taiwan authorities to sit down in dialogue and negotiation with us .
qian qichen affirmed in his address the outstanding accomplishments of the all - china federation of returned overseas chinese and its overall 2000 work requirements .
the all - china federation of returned overseas chinese has proposed placing its 2000 work focus on better " organization and dynamism , " which new substance is very good .
we need to focus on the key strategic plans for national economic development , mobilizing the advantage of overseas chinese resources to the service of the strategies of revitalizing china through science and education and sharply developing western china .
we need to establish widespread contacts with s & t talent among returned overseas chinese , their relatives , and our overseas chinese compatriots , to build a go - between bridge for the work of the new generation of returned overseas chinese and s & t academic interaction .
and we need to stress the good attraction of capital , technology , and intelligence , for a contribution to the development of central and western china and the s & t cause .
all - china federation of returned overseas chinese chairman lin zhaoshu gave a work report at the meeting .
and some of the members who attended the plenary session held a forum today on the white paper on " the one - china principle and the taiwan problem . "
committee chairman li peng took part in today 's group deliberations .
hong fuzeng , zhang xiao , and other committee members indicated : supervisory work occupied an important place in the npc standing committee 's work in the past year ; inspections of law enforcement became even more to the point and more efficient ; and the actual effect of supervision was clearly enhanced .
the people were satisfied with the npc standing committee 's legislative work last year .
gu shanqing and other committee members suggested that it is essential to normalize legislative activities and constantly improve the efficiency and quality of legislative work in order to accomplish the arduous tasks of legislation .
in legislative work , care should be taken to remove departmental colors , to prevent and avoid the interference of departmental interests and protectionism , and to conscientiously uphold impartiality and fairness of the law .
some other committee members opined that in inspecting law enforcement it is necessary to further improve the ways of inspection so as to really be able to carry out inspections without pomps and strictly avoid formalism .
the ninth npc standing committee today also held group deliberations on the draft agenda for the third session of the ninth npc and other matters .
the three - day eighth session of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] ninth national committee standing committee ended this afternoon in beijing .
li ruihuan , member of the cpc central committee political bureau [ politburo ] and cppcc chairman , presided over the meeting this afternoon .
the session is of great significance for the conclusion and beginning of cppcc undertakings at the end of this century and for the next century and for the promotion of the cross - century development of building socialism with chinese characteristics .
however , the us government has remained silent about the human rights situation in its own country .
the " 1999 country reports on human rights practices " released by the us state department on 26 february , which finds fault with the human rights conditions in some 100 countries , has provoked a chorus of condemnation from many countries .
the day before , the new york state supreme court had rendered a verdict acquitting four white police officers who had fatally shot amadou diallo , an innocent black man .
this has inevitably aroused strong displeasure among the public .
as a matter of fact , the diallo incident was by no means an isolated case .
according to us reports , in 1996 , 3,000 people accused the chicago police of wantonly resorting to violence , and more than 1,000 complaints are filed against the police in san francisco each year . and los angeles is asking itself : " why has police conduct gotten so bad ? "
wanton application of violence by the police is only one example of how americans ' civil rights are being trampled upon .
it is no wonder that , upon learning of the court verdict in the diallo case , angry crowds shouted : " there is no fairness and justice to speak of " in the united states .
the federal bureau of investigation and the justice department have promised an investigation into the trial of the diallo case .
the diallo case has once again shown that the " international human rights defender " is trampling upon human rights .
beijing , 29 feb ( xinhua ) - - foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao today expressed indignation at accusations on hong kong 's human rights situation made by the united states regardless of actual facts .
zhu bangzao said that after hong kong 's reversion , china 's central government and the hong kong special administrative region [ hksar ] government implemented the policy of " one country , two systems , " " hong kong people governing hong kong , " and a high degree of autonomy .
protected by the basic law , the broad masses of hong kong people continue to enjoy extensive human rights , democracy , and freedom , a fact widely acknowledged by the international community .
the hksar government and people of all circles in hong kong have criticized the report .
he said the chinese government expresses its firm opposition to that .
beijing , 29 feb (zxs) - - speaking here today , foreign ministry spokesman zhu bangzao refuted taiwan 's distorted statement that " there is one china , with each side having its own interpretation , " and offered a detailed explanation in this respect .
he pointed out that no separatist schemes could possibly succeed .
zhu bangzao said : this argument is a distortion of the consensus reached by the two sides at that time .
the specific formulation employed by arats is : " both sides of the taiwan strait uphold the one - china principle and strive for national reunification .
he pointed out : the distortion by relevant people in taiwan of the consensus on " one china " into " one china , with each side having its own interpretation " is not consistent with the actual situation ; its purpose is to slip in separatist views in the name of different interpretations .
he once again said that the white paper recently released by the chinese side is yet another comprehensive exposition that china offers to the international community on its principled stand on resolving the taiwan issue .
besides , china welcomes the democratic people 's republic of korea [ dprk ] to improve and develop its relations with western developed countries .
chen yaobang , chinese minister of agriculture , and tokuichiro tamazawa , japanese agriculture , forestry , and fisheries minister , had just held talks and reached a consensus on when the agreement should take effect .
he expressed hopes that the visit will benefit peace , stability , and development on the korean peninsula .
the chinese government is cooperating with the un high commissioner for human rights office to hold the eighth asia - pacific human rights seminar in beijing on 1 - 3 march .
mrs. mary robinson , un high commissioner for human rights , will attend the seminar on invitation .
mrs. robinson will meet qian qichen , vice premier of the state council , during her stay in beijing .
relevant leaders of the foreign affairs committee of the national people 's congress [ npc ] and the ministry of foreign affairs will separately hold talks with her to exchange views on issues of mutual concern , including cooperation between the two sides .
since signing the two convenants , relevant departments of the chinese government have actively prepared for the ratification of the two convenants and have conducted massive , comprehensive , and meticulous study on the contents of the convenants .
while doing that , the chinese side had numerous exchanges with western countries on issues concerning the ratification and enforcement of the convenants .
all these show that the chinese side adopts a serious and responsible attitude toward the ratification of the two convenants .
as for the international convenant on civil and political rights , relevant departments of the chinese government are currently studying it in detail .
zhu bangzao said the visit is part of a consensus reached with the us side on the sino - us military exchange program in 2000 when deputy chief of general staff xiong guangkai visited washington at the beginning of the year .
zhu bangzao said that , during his visit in china , admiral blair will meet chinese military leaders and hold consultations with deputy chief of general staff xiong guangkai on sino - us military exchanges and on regional and international issues of mutual concern .
blair will also visit nanjing during his china visit .
reports on china 's economic and financial budget situations will be provided to npc deputies and members of the national committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference [ cppcc ] , and chinese and foreign media also will be given relevant information , so the reports will be quite transparent .
the " report on work of the government , " to be delivered by premier zhu rongji , is an authoritative document reflecting china 's latest political and economic situation , and has already received attention at home and abroad .
it is expected that the report will sum up china 's development experience in 1999 , set forth the government 's general administrative program for 2000 , and provide prospects for china 's intermediate - and long - term development .
the " report on work of the government " and reports on the state 's plan and financial budget will contain last year 's economic development situation and this year 's development targets .
according to the state statistics bureau 's initial forecast , china 's gdp in 1999 was 8.2054 trillion yuan ( renminbi ; same for the following ) . computing using comparable prices , it was 7.1 percent higher than the year before , reaching the set growth target .
an economist of the chinese academy of social sciences revealed that the gdp growth target for 2000 also will be set at about 7 percent .
recently , based on estimates , relevant departments of the state put forward three optional proposals - - setting growth at 8 percent , 7.5 percent , or 7 percent .
relevant reports also will analyze whether the current domestic and international situations are favorable for china to achieve its economic growth target .
this situation will have a positive effect on china 's foreign trade growth .
besides , china will enter the wto some time in the middle of this year , and this also is a good news for china 's exports .
considering these factors , it is expected that china 's exports growth will be higher than last year , and the growth probably will approach 10 percent .
most economists have been of the view that economic growth of 7 percent for this year is attainable ; if things go smoothly , it is possible to reach 7.5 percent .
in relevant reports , it also will be announced that a positive financial policy will be implemented this year - - the third consecutive year . by issuing treasury bonds , the state will make financial investments to increase domestic demand and ensure economic growth .
in the foreseeable future , not only will the renminbi not devalue , but there will be room of its appreciation .
this assures a continued surplus in china 's international payments and for maintaining the stability of the renminbi rate of exchange .
in the science and technology training of troops , it is necessary to put training on joint operation in an outstanding position , improve the mechanisms for joint operation , lay a solid foundation for joint operation , and deeply explore methods for training in joint campaigns .
the " opinions " demanded that units at all levels should mainly and properly grasp the building of the four contingents of commanders , staff personnel , professional technical personnel and instructors , especially the training and bringing up of a large number of military commanding personnel with high comprehensive quality and great ability to carry out renovation .
both sides exchanged views on sino - russian relations and other international issues of interest to both sides in a cordial and friendly atmosphere [ zai qin qie you hao de qi fen zhong 0941 6024 0434 0645 1170 4104 3049 3050 0022 ] .
tang jiaxuan said : in recent years , china and russia have cooperated very well in broad fields of endeavor and their strategic cooperation expanded continuously with noticeable results .
china would work together with russia to inherit and carry forward all the precious wealth the two countries have accumulated to promote bilateral cooperation in various fields to a new high .
ivanov , for his part , expressed his warm welcome for tang jiaxuan 's first visit to russia and believed that the visit would further promote russian - chinese ties .
he said : russia is satisfied with the strategic cooperation with china .
russian deputy prime minister ilya klebanov will visit china shortly and discuss with his hosts bilateral cooperation in the fields of politics , economy and trade . he expressed the hope that klebanov 's trip will achieve positive results .
they exchanged views on the exchange of mutual visits by top leaders this year .
tang jiaxuan reiterated the chinese government 's support for the russian government 's stance on the chechen issue and the actions taken in fighting separatism and religious extremism .
ivanov expressed his high appreciation for china 's just stance on the chechen issue .
the two ministers also discussed other regional and international issues and reached broad consensus .
they pledged to further strengthen cooperation in international affairs .
at the end of their meeting , the two ministers signed the " agreement of the governments of the people 's republic of china and the russian federation on exchange of visits by citizens " on behalf their own governments .
tang jiaxuan arrived in moscow the evening of 28 february and thus started his official visit to russia .
russia 's acting president vladimir putin was scheduled to meet foreign minister tang jiaxuan on 1 march .
lhasa , 1 march ( xinhua ) - - purbu zhoima , director of the tibet autonomous regional family planning commission , said to xinhua reporters today : " the government of the tibet autonomous region has never interfered in or restrained tibetan women 's rights to give birth .
she stressed : " most tibetan women in the rural and pastoral areas now choose to have two or three children while the educated women prefer one child , because their concept of having children has undergone changes and more and more people attach greater importance to rational childbearing . "
dixing , a 45 - year - old woman in the rural area of nedong county in tibet has 11 children .
she said that having too many children constituted a very heavy burden to the family .
reportedly , china 's armed forces staged five large - scale military exercises codenamed " chun " [ 2504 spring ] in the southern waters , north china plain , and the northwest plateau over the past two months .
military figures say that the features of " chen chun " and " ming chun " are aimed at attacking us aircraft carriers .
on 15 february , the airforce of the jinan military region used a number of jets to conduct the cross - sea exercise codenamed " chang chun . " air refueling aircraft were used in the exercise to support the fighters ' long - distance flight .
the air refueling aircraft of china 's airforce , a new model aircraft improved from the 6 - d bomber , was on display for the first time at the national day parade on 1 october last year .
the military figure pointed out that china has studied ways to deal with aircraft carriers for seven to eight years . viewed from the latest achievements , if a war starts across the taiwan straits , there probably will be no aircraft carriers that cannot be sunk .
" feibao " can be favorably compared with the f - 16 . its load of bombs , range , speed and electronic equipment is far better than other fighter planes in the service of the chinese air force .
the radar equipment on the fbc-1 can be favorably compared with that of the f-16, made by the united states , and phantom-2000 fighter planes , made by france , in taiwan .
the displacement of the " song " - class attack submarine is 2,250 tonnes , its maximum underwater speed is 22 knots , and its noise is the lowest of the submarines in the chinese navy .
the 039 is quite completely equipped with weapons , and is capable of launching at its full depth linear - guided [ xian dao 4848 1418 ] torpedoes and anti - ship missiles , and of laying mines .
today 's guangming ribao also reports that the parent of a student in anyang city , henan , took some people to beat up the class teacher because the student had not been assessed " three good " and made a young pioneers team leader .
i also saw some reports like this before , and they are really shocking and cause me deep reflection .
correctly guiding and helping the healthy growth of youths and juveniles to enable them to achieve all - round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development is a major issue with a bearing on the orientation of the development of education in china .
since the founding of new china , the party and government have attached great importance to developing the people 's education and devoted great efforts to it ; there have been tremendous developments in china 's education and large numbers of outstanding talented people have been trained for socialist construction .
china now has a population of 1.25 billion , 240 million of whom are at school .
this is an amazing achievement .
education is systems engineering ; to continually enhance the quality and standards of education , we must not only step up education in cultural knowledge for the students but also tangibly step up their ideological and political education , moral education , discipline education , and education in the legal system .
as " architects of the human soul , " teachers must not only teach well but also cultivate their students well , and be paragons of virtue and learning .
we absolutely cannot bring about certain negative or even reverse consequences as a result of improper handling of these issues . the burdens on some students are too heavy at present , and this forms very great mental pressure on them .
it is right that the schools and the homes demand and encourage youngsters to study intensively and assiduously ; unless they assiduously study and temper themselves , it is very hard for young people to grow up , but there must be correct guiding ideas and teaching methods .
there are many lessons in this respect , and we should take warning from them .
we cannot shut up young students in books and rooms all day ; we must let them take part in some social practice to broaden their vision and enhance their social experience .
schools are important gardens for cultivating talent , and education is a lofty undertaking for the good of society .
tertiary education is now developing very rapidly in china , and there was a big increase in the number of its students last year .
society needs all kinds of talented people .
" all the 360 trades produce the very best . "
we cannot look at the question in this way today .
in the 21 st century , china needs to develop knowledge - intensive industries and also still needs to develop labor - intensive industries ; economic construction and social development set a variety of demands on talent .
this is the objective demand of china 's national condition and of all - round economic and social development .
we should conduct good publicity on this viewpoint throughout the whole of society .
this work should be done not only by the education departments but also by the propaganda and ideological departments , the political departments , and other departments , and by the whole party and the whole of society .
it is necessary to develop a healthy atmosphere in the schools and among the students ; we must certainly not allow unhealthy trends to raise their heads .
we must step up ideological education regarding bad student behavior , severely punish violations of law according to law , and absolutely not indulge them .
we must concentrate efforts on sorting out the bad social order situation that has recently been apparent in and around certain schools .
we must regularly conduct education in discipline and legal system for the students , to strengthen their concept of discipline and legal system , so that they will understand that they must observe discipline and law .
we must ensure a peaceful , harmonious , and healthy environment for the students ' studies .
ours is a socialist country under communist party leadership , and we must and can succeed in this respect .
these are : reforming the state - owned enterprises and extricating them from difficulty ; the large - scale development of west china ; china 's entry into the world trade organization [ wto ] ; rejuvenating the country through science and education ; opposing corruption ; and the taiwan problem .
this is the third year in achieving this goal , and attention to whether the chinese government can win decisive victory is redoubled .
twelve of the 14 existing industrial departments have reversed their loss - making situation , the exceptions being the defense industry and coal .
while reducing the losses in the original loss - making enterprises , is it possible to prevent the emergence of new loss - makers ?
has extricating the state enterprises from difficulties depended too much on help from the state 's favored treatment policy , or is it built on the firm basis of deepening the reforms and strengthening management ? . . .
instituting the large - scale development of west china is a major policy decision of the central authorities , made at the turn of the century , which involves the overall situation .
the central authorities ' call for great development of the west has evoked a response throughout the country ; people pin great hopes on this , and tremendous enthusiasm is mounting .
the time is not far off when china will join the wto this year .
wto accession is a major affair in the process of china 's reforms , opening up , and modernization , and it will have a far - reaching impact on china 's economic development in the new century .
how can china reap the benefits while avoiding the pitfalls ?
this will naturally be a topic of concern to all the deputies and committee members .
as the new century opens , every country in the world is working to enhance its science and technology competitiveness in the expectation of occupying a favorable position in the competition in all - round national strength during the century .
we should realize that although science and technology in china is developing with every passing day , the general level lags far behind that of developed countries .
although the massive smuggling case involving yuan hua is still being dealt with , and details and results of the case will not be announced at the " two sessions " this year , a series of major cases previously dealt with have already aroused a strong reaction among all sectors of society .
history has pushed the taiwan problem to an important juncture when there can be no evasion or long delay .
this important policy statement demonstrates the mainland 's resolve and sense of urgency for spurring the process of peaceful reunification .
li urged the province 's entry and exit inspection and quarantine institutions to do well and work in real earnest in four aspects ; help the province 's enterprises open up the international market ; and contribute more to the province 's two civilizations building .
only by complying with the general trend of globalization of the world economy and further merging with the international economy will it be possible to grasp the opportunity and speed up our development .
li stressed : we must take the initiative to fight a battle in the face of economic globalization .
we must take the initiative to go out to serve our modernization building by making full use of two types of resources , two markets , and two technological sources , namely , those at home and abroad .
li pointed out : under the present circumstances , the entry and exit inspection and quarantine institutions , which are in the forefront of opening up to the outside world , are also faced with a series of new situations .
the central government recently made a policy decision to carry out a " large - scale development of the western region . "
since reform and opening up , the central authorities have put the focus of development on the eastern ( and southern , the same below ) region along the coast .
hitherto , it is a correct decision to place the focus of development on the eastern region .
besides , foreign investors were encouraged to make investment in the central and western regions , and the eastern region was also encouraged to give assistance to the central and western regions in various ways .
accelerating the exploitation of the rich natural resources in the western region brooks no delay , otherwise the development of the eastern region and even the entire country will be restricted by the inadequacy of natural resources .
third , in the geographic distribution of china 's population , the eastern and western regions respectively account for approximately 40 and 60 percent of the total .
fourth , focusing the development on the eastern region has led to the wider gap between the eastern region and the central and western regions .
the proportions of the total output value of the eastern , central , and western regions in the gdp were respectively 50.1 percent , 34.3 percent , and 15.6 percent in 1978 , and 58.3 percent , 27.9 percent , and 13.8 percent in 1998 .
this is what people often say " peacocks flying to the southeastern land . "
if we fail to reverse the direction of the flow of resources , the development of the central and western regions , the latter in particular , will be impaired .
fifth , china is a country with multiple ethnic groups , and a harmonious ethnic relationship is one of the major prerequisites for the society to maintain stability , the economy to attain development , and the people 's lives to be improved .
the western region is where numerous chinese minority ethnic groups live in compact communities .
the central government has always showed concerns for the economic development and the enhancement of the people 's living standards in the regions inhabited by minority nationalities , and granted them enormous support in financial aid and other aspects .
the practice of the omnidirectional opening up has turned the western region to be a forward position and has enabled china to maintain considerably closer economic contacts with the contiguous countries in the north , west , and southwest .
conditions for western development the large - scale western development is a great strategic change in china 's distribution of economic areas which has tremendous and profound significance .
at present , there are a lot of favorable conditions that have made this momentous change possible .
third , china 's market economic structure is getting into shape so that we can make use of the market strength to expedite the development in the western region .
fourth , after years of development , the western region has initially possessed the soft environment for attracting foreign investment , and more and more overseas enterprises , having realized the enormous potential for the western development , have come one after another to make investment in the western region .
of course , it is not easy to develop the western region , and it is even more difficult than the development of the eastern region at the early stage of reform .
for this reason , the central authorities should render all - out assistance , the western region itself should make great efforts , and the eastern region should extend its support to and cooperation with the western region .
several steps that should be taken with regard to the central government 's assistance , first of all , it is drafting a plan for the large - scale development of the western region so as to push forward the work step by step .
the development of the western region can only surge forward wave upon wave .
fourth , the central government should grant greater decisionmaking powers to the western region in devising economic development policies and in issues related to reform and opening up in light of local conditions in order to arouse the initiative and enthusiasm of the local governments .
so far as the western region is concerned , first , it should give impetus to the further emancipation of the minds among the cadres and masses and smash the trammels of the outmoded ideas , traditions , styles , and habits to suit the situation of the large - scale western development and the market economic order .
second , the western region should create favorable soft and hard environments for attracting resources from other regions and outside the country , and particularly for absorbing qualified personnel and technologies .
third , it should adopt various policies and measures to encourage the local resources , particularly the nongovernmental resources , to be used in its own development .
the low proportion of nonpublic sectors and slow growth is another major cause that the western region was unable to make faster advance .
although quite a few areas in the western region have rich resources , owing to the abominable natural conditions such as shortage of water , extremely poor transport facilities , harsh climate , and others , it needs serious exploration into how they should exploit their favorable conditions to the full and avoid the unfavorable ones .
let us just talk about overcoming the unfavorable factors of the long distance between the producing areas and markets and high transportation costs , it is imperative to ensure that the locally made products have the merits of good quality , low costs , high added value , small size , light weight , and be convenient for transportation .
this is another example of making the best use of the advantages while bypassing the disadvantages . finally , the greatest shortages of resources in the western region are cadres , and technical and managerial personnel .
for this reason , it should not only import qualified personnel from other regions , but more importantly , it should step up the training of local talented people .
however , it seams that this ideal is still far away from the chinese .
however , this might in fact represent a misunderstanding zone .
since the may fourth movement , the struggles engaged by the chinese people in their pursue of democracy have always been accompanied by fierce political movements , with passionate mass parades and fervent slogans which are spread nationwide in a short period of time .
democracy must have vigor and vitality . democracy must have closed ties with mass parades or similar actions such as strikes staged by workers or students .
democracy must serve to resolve contemporary urgent social , political , or economic problems . a parallel thinking is this : whenever a political , economic , or social problem cannot be resolved , people naturally pin their hopes on democracy . when there is no crisis , it seems that the progress of democracy is not very important .
they have accustomed to this idea : the first thing to do is to destroy all the things that are old .
the appearance of this situation has something to do with our tradition , which is as long as our history .
particularly at a time when china met with imperial invasion and the survival of the chinese nation was at a critical moment , various elements for reforms will naturally demand to put democracy into practice in this land of ours . they want to realize this fine political culture and system with an unprecedented enthusiasm and speed .
another factor has something to do with the chinese people 's persistent goal - - a situation where everything is perfect .
due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure china 's political and social problems .
as a result , the above - mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created . in fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .
this kind of democratic movement , which is innately insufficient , naturally has left with many sequels .
one of the most serious problems is this : it is very easy that a democratic movement is turned into a ruffian movement [ pi zi yun dong 4028 1311 6663 0520 ] or an opportunity for some people to change their own situation .
it will be very easy for many sincerer people to change their political attitude from extremely enthusiastic to sternly cool one .
when lord ye saw the real dragon thrusting in its head through the window of his study and its tail moving in his palace , he was frightened out of the house for his life .
clearly , what lord ye loved was not the real dragons . ] many chinese intellectuals long for the advent of democracy ; but they fear that once democracy indeed arrives , it will cause an inevitable social calamity , thus destroying the results of progress that society has achieved .
the chinese people 's political consultative conference has been resuming its role . people have paid more attention to the calls of the national people 's congress . various laws have been promulgated . lawyers who specialize in different legal domains have begun to be an indispensable part of our social life .
during the course of economic development , china successfully achieved a soft landing .
for example , some primary and middle schools place undue emphasis on the rate of pupils advancing to higher grades , burden pupils with heavy schoolwork , and slacken ideological education , thereby giving rise to adverse consequences .
the recent string of vicious incidents involving some primary and middle school pupils and their parents have caused concern among the people .
at a time when people are worried , comrade jiang zemin gave a " talk concerning educational issues . "
the talk shows strategic insight and has rich substance and far - reaching significance .
to study and act on the spirit of the talk , first and foremost , it is necessary to deeply understand the extreme importance of comrade jiang zemin 's talk .
comrade jiang zemin 's call for approaching educational issues " from the perspective of the rise or fall of a nation 's fortunes and national rejuvenation " has enlightened us .
we should never develop education at the expense of the younger generation 's ideological and political quality ; otherwise , the future of the country as a whole , not just that of a generation or several generations of young people , will be adversely affected .
schools are not the only one to blame for the various problems associated with some young people ; these problems also reflect the influences of society .
treating education as an integrated system will help mobilize all sectors of society to show concern and support for education and to promote educational reform and development .
educational administrative departments and schools at all levels must steadfastly implement the educational policy of " making education serve the socialist cause and combining education with social practice , " and devote great efforts to improving school administration .
to study and act on the spirit of the talk , it is necessary to fully recognize the importance and urgency of " reducing the course load " of primary and middle school pupils .
comrade jiang zemin said : " the rise or fall of a nation 's fortunes depends on education ; the vigorous development of education is the responsibility of all the people . "
the broad ranks of young pupils are the future and hope of our nation .
their healthy growth and all - around development have a direct impact on the success of our endeavors and on china 's bright prospects in the 21 st century .
he has been devoted to the supervision and management of banks for a long period of time , so that he acquires a higher understanding of specialized theories and financial policies .
they believed that real philosophy in a specific era represents the quintessential ideological achievements of that era and gives a concentrated expression to the spiritual essence of civilization of every specific society .
this profound scientific conclusion has not only pointed out the position and the role of philosophy in the entire human life , but has also provided a most important and most reliable clue for people to understand the historical conditions and fate of philosophy .
his remarks gave an extremely penetrating explanation to the social significance of advanced philosophy .
if the human society is to make further development , progress , and innovation , it has to , first of all , emancipate its mind and cast itself from spiritual shackles ; and only in this way can it enjoy the motive power and develop the ability to make creations .
were it not for the exposure and criticism made by modern materialist philosophy against religious theology , no one would know how many more giordano burno would have been sent to the execution ground .
as it is known to all , marx discovered the law of surplus value , and turned socialism from an utopian idea into a science , thus changing the history of the mankind .
however , the " credit " to his great contribution should also to a revolutionary change in philosophy - - his founding of historical materialism , a brand - new system of world outlook and methodology that can scientifically reveal the law of the historical development of mankind .
a comparison of the two shows clearly that the latter is a fundamental condition , which serves as the foundation and precondition of the former .
that explains the reason why the founders of our great cause , that is , the founders of marxism and their successors , have all set an extremely high value on philosophy .
to temper and enhance our ability and our level of theoretical thinking , there is no better way than studying the past history of philosophy .
in the early 1980 s , comrade deng xiaoping once criticized the trend of drowning oneself in the routine work , " knowing nothing about philosophy , " neglecting the importance of philosophy , and handling affairs with oversimplified and one - sided mentalities and work methods among some of our leading cadres .
in recent years , comrade jiang zemin published many important speeches , in which he has repeatedly urged the comrades of the whole party , especially the leading cadres of the party , to approach and strengthen their theoretical studies from the high plane of stressing on politics .
they do not understand this because they have failed to approach our cause from the high plane of an overall social development ; in other words , they still need to emancipate their minds on a constant basis .
comrade deng xiaoping said : " the cause we are currently engaged in is a brand - new cause . "
building socialism with chinese characteristics is a great pioneering undertaking without parallel in history .
judging by the requirements mentioned above , we cannot say that the task of ideological emancipation has already been completed .
at present , china 's reform has entered a difficulty - tackling stage , and its development is in the middle of a crucial moment .
to accomplish this , we need the guidance of philosophy .
to gain such an understanding on the objective law , we must rely on theoretical thinking , and this can by no means be accomplished through observations of experiences or a direct - view thinking .
everyone with sufficient experiences in life will have certain philosophical thinking , and certain concepts and methods , in his mind .
such thinking is acting on us all the time .
the point is that we should know clearly what kind of a philosophy it is ; and should ask ourselves the question as whether it is an advanced or backward , correct or erroneous , philosophy .
of course , stressing the importance of philosophy has a more extensive implication .
this refers to the role of philosophy as a foundation and guidance in the entire spiritual civilization .
philosophy is a science that deals with the outlook on the world , the history , the life , and values ; and instead of simply providing a tool for us to understanding our work in different fields , philosophy also has the task of providing necessary basic theories , concepts , and methods for the entire spiritual cultural .
in other fields of the spiritual civilization in society , such as science , culture , education , ethics , art , law , politics , and the way of daily life of the common people , we can always see the infiltration and the expression of certain philosophical thoughts , beliefs , concepts , and ways of thinking .
therefore , the conditions of philosophy will inevitably have an effect on the conditions of the spiritual civilization at a deeper level .
a man who understands and knows how to use philosophy will be a wise man , a man with a rich and happy spiritual life , for he has already taken onto a road which leads to " the realm of freedom . "
at the turn of centuries and millenniums , the human society is experiencing a most extensive and most profound change in history .
the changes in the world have brought new opportunities to the chinese nation which has a population of over 1.2 billion and enjoys an over 5,000 - year - long civilization .
this road is the product of an integration between marxism and china 's realities , and also a new creation china has made in the face of the new situation in today 's world .
during this process , we still cannot do without , but have a greater need than others , to value a flourishing and innovative growth of philosophy .
without philosophy , and without the development of marxist philosophy along with the development of our time in particular , there can hardly be any emancipation of the mind in real terms ; and without the emancipation of the mind , there can hardly be any high - level and creative work or a spiritual civilization .
to further emancipate the mind at the current critical juncture of comprehensively pushing our cause into the 21 st century , we ought to attach great importance to philosophy , promote the growth of philosophy , and give full play to the role of philosophy as " an emancipated mind . "
( this article is abridged and revised from a speech made by the author at an academic symposium named " the 50 years of philosophy in new china " in october 1999 )
a plenary meeting of the 14 th session of the national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee was held this morning to again deliberate on the npc standing committee 's decision on stepping up supervision over economic work , and the meeting approved the decision .
the decision said : the npc standing committee exercises its power to supervise the state council 's economic work according to law in order to truly perform the duty entrusted to the npc and its standing committee by the constitution and law to ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .
the seventh article of the decision said : entrusted by a chairmanship meeting , relevant special committees of the npc may hold a plenary meeting to hear special reports by relevant departments of the state council .
members of the npc standing committee were of the opinion that establishment of the decision has created necessary conditions for establishing a supervision law , and will help local people 's congresses step up supervision over local economic work as well .
beijing , 1 mar ( xinhua ) - - li peng , chairman of the national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee , said here today that the upcoming third session of the ninth npc is an important meeting held at the turn of the century .
the session examined the draft work report of the npc standing committee . it decided that the draft , after having being amended in accordance with the opinions offered by members of the npc standing committee , will be submitted to the third session of the ninth npc for examination .
chairman li peng chaired and addressed the forum .
he emphasized that the marxist theory of state power is a major part of marxist political science .
china 's people 's congress system is precisely the outcome of the integration of the marxist theory of state power with the specific practice of china 's revolution .
wang huiyan , professor at jilin university , was invited to give a lecture today . the title of his lecture was " several basic issues of marxist theory of state power . "
before the lecture began , li peng made a speech .
this should become a system and be carried on because it is very important to the work of the npc standing committee .
politics belongs to the superstructure , and all of the state , political power , democracy , legal administration , rights , duties , equality , and freedom belong to the realm of politics . meanwhile , political science is a science to research political phenomena and the related laws .
to this end , senior cadres are required to study hard not only political science and economics but also the knowledge of laws , science - technology , history , and culture , particularly the marxist political science .
this is the only way to secure a correct political stand and viewpoint , to enhance their political sharpness and discernment , and to always keep sober - minded and have scientific understanding and firm confidence on the road of advance .
the cpc - led cause of building socialism with chinese characteristics is an unprecedented great cause .
also attending were he chunlin , secretary general of the npc standing committee .
he said : different countries face different situations . it is normal to have differences in our approach and means of promoting and protecting human rights , and we should handle these differences appropriately through dialogue and exchanges on an equal footing .
the overwhelming majority of asia - pacific countries have had painful experiences of being bullied by big powers in modern times . therefore these countries all the more cherish their sovereign rights and national pride .
asia - pacific countries are also one of major forces with whom the international community have vigorously promoted dialogue and exchanges in recent years . the asia - pacific human rights workshop is a concrete manifestation of such spirit of cooperation based on equality .
qian qichen stressed that asia - pacific countries should strengthen their joint actions in realizing economic , social , and cultural rights as well as development rights .
we cannot simply copy from foreign countries when learning from their experiences . only by following our own country 's characteristics and our people 's needs , and adopting appropriate measures that suit local situations , can we effectively expand and improve democracy , and promote and strengthen the rule of law .
universality does not mean blind identity . all measures that can truly promote and protect human rights and all organizations and plans that can play an effective role should be encouraged and given recognition .
the enormous vitality shown by china today reflects in a lively manner the fact that the chinese people have vast room to freely and democratically give play to their creativity .
the asia - pacific human rights workshop is an important forum where asia - pacific countries discuss how to strengthen cooperation on human rights in the asia - pacific region .
the meeting elected wang guangya , chinese vice minister of foreign affairs , to be the chairman .
hong kong , 1 march (zts) - - in china , embezzlement and bribe - taking cases of government officials happen from time to time , and the situation of anticorruption is still grave .
to administer the country , it is first of all necessary to administer the party whose affairs must be strictly administered , and in this respect it is fist of all necessary to do a good job of administering leadership teams and leading cadres , jiang zemin pointed out .
according to reports , " emphasizing three things " education has been concluded for the current phase at the level of central ministries and departments , the provincial and municipal level , and the department and bureau level , but " emphasizing three things " education is still being carried out at the county ( city ) level nationwide .
the county ( city ) level occupies the important position of linking the lower levels with the upper levels in the cpc 's organization structure , the government structure of the state , and overall work and is also an important foundation for china 's economic development , social stability , and the solidity of state power .
therefore , it is of special , great significance to do a good job of carrying out " emphasizing three things " education at the over 2,000 counties ( cities ) nationwide .
immediately after the spring festival , the seven members of the standing committee of the political bureau of the cpc central committee went to different provinces and municipalities to conduct inspections , investigations , and study and to personally speak to county - level leadership teams on " emphasizing three things . "
this year will be a critical year for achieving objectives of anticorruption work set by the 15 th cpc congress , and the cpc top leadership has called for focusing on prevention at the sources and rectification , so as to produce new achievements in party conduct and clean government construction and in the anticorruption struggle .
the communique of the fourth plenary meeting of the central disciplinary inspection commissions also said that it was necessary to concentrate forces , so as to break a number of big , major cases .
currently central judicial departments are investigating the extra - large smuggling case of the yuanhua company of xiamen , a case in which the deputy secretary of the cpc municipal committee and the deputy mayor were involved in the case ; the results of the investigation may be announced shortly .
in fact , to eliminate sources of corruption , the authorities have already adopted a series of measures .
according to a source , to regularize anticorruption struggle , the national people 's congress session this year will , in addition to adopting decisions on supervising economic work , also consider area - specific supervision laws and the issue of establishing effective and practicable supervision mechanisms , so as to gradually implement clean government construction .
zhou yongkang , former minister of land and resources , was appointed secretary of the sichuan provincial cpc committee prior to this .
tian fengshan , who was born in zhaoyuan county , heilongjiang province , took part in work since july 1961 and joined the cpc in march 1970 .
in 1964 , he concluded his study at the xian second artillery technical academy of the people 's liberation army and became a teacher , secretary of the party committee of the commune , director of the revolutionary committee , and deputy secretary of the party committee , and deputy head , of zhaoyuan county , his hometown .
he has great ability in organization and coordination work , has rich experience in leadership work , has seriously implemented the principle of democratic centralism , has the style of going deep into matters , and is an appropriate person for the post of minister of land and resources .
beijing , 1 mar ( xinhua ) - - decision of the national people 's congress [ npc ] standing committee on strengthening supervision over economic work adopted at the 14 th standing committee meeting of the ninth npc on 1 march 2000 .
the draft annual national economic and social development plan , draft five - year plan , and draft long - term plan formulated by the state council should be submitted to the npc standing committee one month before the npc session is held . 3 .
whenever necessary , the npc standing committee may hear , examine , and discuss the state council 's special reports on economic work .
the npc standing committee should supervise the implementation of the national economic and social development plan .
the financial and economic committee should hold plenary meetings in the first half of april , july , and october to hear , analyze , and study the reports given by relevant state council departments on the economic operations of the first quarter , the first half , and the first three quarters of the year . 9 .
when the npc standing committee holds a meeting to examine and discuss the items listed in this decision , the state council should provide relevant information and explanations in a timely manner whenever necessary and send state council responsible officials or responsible officials of relevant departments to attend the meeting to hear opinions and answer questions .
the ministry of land and resources has already sent the inspection report to the respective departments in charge for their further studies , and relevant departments have also put forward their preliminary opinions on work improvements .
he pointed out : this inspection shows the implementation of the system of multi - party cooperation and political consultations under the cpc leadership , and has proved to be a good way for democratic parties and non - party personages to participate in state affairs .
in recent years , the work of protecting and making rational use of national land and resources has undergone further improvements .
the " law of the people 's republic of china for the protection of the marine environment , " which was promulgated by the npc not long ago , will be of great significance in promoting a sustainable growth in marine resources .
in view of this , we must unremittingly educate our vast numbers of cadres , especially party and government leaders at all levels , on the policies and laws that are designed for the protection and rational use of resources , so as to enhance their understanding on the importance of this task .
we should tighten control over the implementation of land resource plans .
at present , out of their local and immediate interests , some localities have illegally occupied farmland for other purposes under all sorts of different pretexts , and have issued land - use and mineral - production licenses beyond their authority .
deepening scientific and technological training is a pressing task for the training of the whole army and preparations made for military struggles .
it is the sacred mission of the whole army to defend the country 's security , unification , and territorial integrity .
as future wars will be fought under hi - tech conditions , we should train our soldiers in the hi - tech background .
we must closely associate our military training with our army 's preparations for military struggles , strive to deepen scientific and technological training , make efforts to improve the troops ' combat effectiveness with science and technology , and ensure that our troops can " win wars . "
the editorial pointed out that training soldiers with science and technology is a deep reform representing a milestone in the history of our military training .
it should be noted that military training is the basic way to produce and enhance combat effectiveness in the peaceful period and that it would be very difficult to achieve a leap forward in the quality of military training only through increasing the intensity and prolonging the time of training .
to change ways of increasing combat effectiveness and follow a new road of training and development , the only choice is to seek combat effectiveness through science and technology .
the difficulty with respect to china 's modernization does not lie in the east , but rather in the west .
and the important way station in china 's modernization may well turn out to lie in the western region .
this view was made public by wang mengkui in his talk at a recent seminar .
according to wang mengkui , our nation is a large developing country with extensive border regions ; because there exist great inequalities between the prevailing conditions for and basis of economic development in these various regions , the challenges presented by and the pace of realizing modernization in each place are also different .
we should be prepared to concentrate on the issue of opening up the west for the duration of the 21 st century .
speaking about the phased nature of opening up the west , wang mengkui stated that the opening up of the western region requires careful planning , an ordered sequence and gradual steps .
wang mengkui said that opening up the west requires expansion of the functions of government ; this point is a certainty .
questions that need further investigation are : what are the resources that can be provided by government ?
what policies can be applied by government ?
increasing the dynamics of shifted payment will provide much more support to infrastructure construction in the western region ; this is something that is already underway at the national level , and will without doubt continue .
beijing , 1 march ( xinhua ) - - after accomplishing all the agenda satisfactorily , the 14 th meeting of the standing committee of the ninth national people 's congress [ npc ] concluded today in the great hall of the people .
the meeting today also passed in principle the draft work report of the npc standing committee . the draft work report will be revised at the chairmanship meeting in line with the opinions proposed by standing committee members , and then being submitted to the third session of the ninth npc .
the appointment and removal of the minister of land and natural resources and other personnel were also approved at the meeting .
he said : the standing committee meeting reexamined and approved the decision of the npc standing committee on strengthening economic supervision .
the decision summed up the basic experiences of the npc standing committee over the past years in economic supervision , adopted the opinions posed at the first examination meeting , and suggested practical methods for carrying out the work in this respect .
the decision is of great importance in terms of manifesting the npc standing committee 's performance of duty enshrined by the constitution and the law , in enhancing and standardizing the supervision over the government 's economic work , and in ensuring the national economy to develop in a sustained , rapid , and healthy manner .
li peng held , since reform and opening up , china 's culture market has witnessed great development , but faced some problems that should be quickly resolved as well .
it is imperative for us to improve the management of culture market , and steer it to a correct direction with a proper handling of the relationship between the development of culture market and social advancement , the relationship between social benefits and economic returns , and the relationship between the culture market 's prosperity and management .
li peng said : another important task of the meeting was to prepare for the third session of the ninth people 's congress .
the third session of the ninth npc will be an important meeting at the turn of the century .
the standing committee members should take the initiative to receive supervision from the people 's congress . standing committee members should listen to deputies ' opinions modestly in a bid to improve the work of the standing committee hereafter and honor the duty enshrined by the constitutions and laws in a down - to - earth manner .
thank you mr. chairman , thank you all for graciously attending this seminar .
my own life is linked to the cause of china 's reforms .
the fact that reform is the main topic of this seminar today is a tremendous honor for mew , and also a spur to me .
i will now give my own observations in reviewing the more than 20 years of reform in china and will also look toward the future of the reforms ; please make your criticisms .
china 's reforms have achieved very great success .
the basic yardstick of this success is that the outline of a market economy based on mixed ownership has now emerged .
take industry , for instance ; the output value of state enterprises in industry as a whole declined from 78 percent in 1978 to 33 percent last year , while the share of non - state - owned economy has risen from 22.2 percent to 67 percent .
under the impetus of market forces , china 's economy has developed at flying speed in the past 20 years , and living standards have risen everywhere ; this point is recognized by the world .
we must also realize however that from the angle of changing the pattern of resource allocation , we have not yet made the big breakthrough in reform .
the 14 th party congress specifically pointed out that the basic content of economic reform is to change the pattern of resource allocation and switch from planned economy to market economy which exploits the basic nature of the market in resource allocation .
although the proportion of state - owned economy in gdp is not high now , being only about one - third , in terms of the amount of economic resources it takes up , state - owned economy still occupies the main position .
and the reform of the state - owned economy is by no means satisfactory , and we are very far from being able to say that the market is now playing a basic role in this part of resource allocation .
for instance , the system root of the problem of " duplicate construction " which we have discussed a great deal and which greatly concerns the government lies in the fact that state - owned economy has not been fundamentally reformed and reorganized , and occupies the most important position in resource control .
we could cite many similar problems ; for instance , the lowering of the efficiency of state - owned economy leads to fragility in the financial system , and so on .
that the income level and living standards of the peasants cannot be improved has now become a serious economic and social problem .
how can they be enabled to get rich ?
from the viewpoint of economics , a key condition is to shift 150 to 200 million surplus rural laborers to nonagricultural occupations .
it is because our industry and commerce lack creative vitality , or else their vitality has not been exploited .
there are two aspects to this question , one is that state - owned economy has not been fundamentally revamped , and the other is that non - state - owned economy has not been properly developed .
why did this state of affairs come about ?
i think an important reason is that some people possess extremely complex and deep - rooted vested interests in the old state - owned economy .
in particular , the cream of society has major interests in the old state - owned economy .
thus , we will encounter very great resistance in reforming and reorganizing state - owned economy and developing non - state - owned economy .
i recently spent some time in hungary .
is there a similar problem in china ?
in addition , in 1984 the third plenary session of the 12 th cpc central committee issued the famous " decision of the cpc central committee on reform of the economic system . "
reforms in this respect , however , have not proceeded very smoothly .
as everyone knows , in line with the " three benefits " principle , the 15 th party congress decided to readjust and perfect the ownership structure of the national economy and establish the basic economic system for a long time to come .
last year 's fourth plenary session of the 15 th cpc central committee made the guidelines of the 15 th party congress more specific .
it should be said that the guidelines and policies of the cpc central committee and the chinese government are correct , and the problem now is to implement them .
in the past two years a phenomenon has existed which causes anxiety , that is , there is a trend in the state - owned departments to neglect reform and reorganization and to enthusiastically engage in " rushing to the ministries for money . "
if , however , this is turned into a long - term policy for mobilizing nongovernmental resources and saving state enterprises , this will cause a whole series of negative microeconomic and macroeconomic consequences .
in addition , using this method over a long period will excessively increase the treasury burden and threaten economic and social stability .
what are the ways out for us in these circumstances ?
all this work is very arduous .
what is the correct guideline for resolving these problems ?
however we nave not done anything like enough regarding what practical steps to take to ensure true vitality for our native economy .
unless we break through these areas of misunderstanding , it will be very hard to implement the decisions of the 15 th party congress and the fourth plenary session of the 15 th central committee .
according to the spirit of the 15 th party congress and the fourth plenary session of the 15 th central committee , there are two things that must be done : first , completely let go those state - owned medium - sized and small enterprises in places where they have not been completely let go .
we are glad that a number of regions have now emerged that have implemented the central policies and guidelines relatively well , with the result that their economy is flourishing and there is full employment and social stability .
for example , this new atmosphere has emerged in most parts of zhejiang province .
since these areas where objective conditions are not particularly good can achieve this , other areas where conditions are better can naturally do the same .
from this angle , the prospects for china 's development are optimistic .
the meeting stressed that the party central committee with comrade jiang zemin at the core has placed the task of strengthening and improving the ideological and political work before the whole party as a major issue of an overall , strategic , and leading significance .
we must act in line with the requirement of general secretary jiang : the more we need to deepen reform , expand the scope of opening up , and develop a socialist market economy , the more we should set a great value on and should strengthen the ideological and political work .
we should keep to a correct orientation in our work , give wide publicity to the main theme of our time , carry forward and develop healthy trends in society , and occupy the front of mass culture with healthy and beneficial activities .
exhibition halls , museums , science museums , libraries , cultural centers , cinemas , entertainment venues , and tourist spots are all required to propagate a spiritual civilization , oppose feudal and superstitious ideas , and resist vulgar interests .
the meeting urged efforts to summarize a number of advanced models and experiences in the ideological and political work .
it is necessary to organize the publication of a batch of articles that carry a lot of weight and enjoy great profundity , with a view to providing clear and persuasive answers to the specific questions that are concerned by the masses .
ding guangen stressed : the " three - stresses " education has a vital importance to the future and the fate of the party ; to the overall situation of reform , development , and stability ; and to the great cause of rejuvenation of our nation .
beijing , march 1 - - the taiwan authorities have been using every means in their power to purchase " western weapons " in large quantities . after nearly 20 years of spare - no - expense military purchases , taiwan 's troops are indeed equipped with a large quantity of advanced arms and equipment .
however , if war breaks out because of taiwan 's quest for independence , these western weapons will not be able to play a decisive role in cross - strait military conflicts .
the practice of modern wars as well as historical experience and lessons both show that a couple of new weapons cannot stop the advance of history .
these were comments made by wang weixing , a research fellow at the institute of strategic studies of the academy of military science .
today 's jiefangjun bao devoted a full page to this interview , entitled " western weapons cannot stop the reunification of the motherland . "
wang weixing said : on the surface , the weaponry of taiwan 's troops appears quite well - developed in terms of scale and systems .
however , if we analyze it more carefully , we will discover that very little of its weapons , particularly hi - tech weapons , are locally manufactured . most of them were acquired from western countries . the most striking problem about them is that they come in many varieties and have different origins .
depletion is alarming in modern hi - tech wars . the more advanced the weaponry , the greater the depletion due to destruction from attacks and the war itself .
if the " pro - independence " splittist forces are bent on splitting the motherland and war breaks out as a result , the weaponry of taiwan 's troops simply cannot afford the depletion .
moreover , since taiwan cannot make any of the hi - tech weapons , the initiative to make replenishments is in the hands of others .
it has no say in the matter at all .
taiwan 's geographical environment is such that it is impossible to bring the maximum capability of high - performance weapons into play .
on the close links between the military purchases of the taiwan authorities and the pace of li teng - hui 's quest for taiwan 's independence , he pointed out : put more plainly , military purchases out of political objectives are political gambles by li teng - hui and a handful of irresponsible politicians .
first , they are doing their best to please the united states by making military purchases and trying to drag the americans down into the water by putting more money in their pocket .
they are hoping to obstruct the reunification of the motherland by forming an alliance with the united states and japan . second , they are trying to highlight us support and assistance to the taiwan authorities through us arms sales to taiwan in order to deceive the public .
the taiwan authorities spent more than us $ 43 billion on arms purchases over the past two decades . on this question , wang weixing said : the money spent by the taiwan authorities on arms purchases is essentially the hard - earned money of people on both sides of the strait .
the taiwan authorities are doing the biggest blaspheme against peaceful cross - strait trade and hurling the biggest insult at the chinese people on both sides of the strait by purchasing arms to split the motherland and seeking independence .
there were three deputies dismissed , namely , han jingchang from jiangxi , zhang kuntong from henan , and yu guoxin from guangxi .
this announcement was hereby published . [ signed ] npc standing committee [ dated ] 1 march 2000
moscow , 1 mar ( xinhua ) - - a joint communiqu on the visit of russia by the foreign minister of the people 's republic of china was published on 1 march in moscow .
full text of the communiqu as follows : at the invitation of igor ivanov , foreign minister of the russian federation , tang jiaxuan , foreign minister of the people 's republic of china , made an official visit to the russian federation between 28 february and 1 march 2000 .
vladmir putin , acting president and premier of the russian federation , met with foreign minister tang jiaxuan .
tang jiaxuan handed a letter from jiang zemin , the president of the people 's republic of china , to putin .
both sides reaffirmed that there would be another sino - russian summit meeting this year .
both sides agreed to make earnest preparations to achieve marked and practical results in the regular meetings between the sino - russian premiers .
during the talks , tang jiaxuan and ivanov satisfactorily pointed out that the mutual cooperation between china and russia was not directed at third countries and that such a cooperation would increasingly become a major factor promoting a multi - polar world and the establishment of a just and reasonable international order .
both sides stressed that any acts that aim at undermining sovereign nations ' territorial integrity are unacceptable .
both sides pointed out that maintaining global strategic stability under the present situation is of special significance to safeguard world peace .
both sides agreed to continuously enhance and deepen the two countries ' cooperation in this area .
the two countries ' foreign ministers reaffirmed that the two nations have consensus on the issue of ensuring security and stability in their peripheral regions , such as asia - pacific , central asia and south asia .
both sides expressed the willingness to comprehensively promote the cooperation within the framework of the " shanghai five . "
china and russia support the active organizational efforts made by asia - pacific regions in maintaining regional security . the two countries reaffirmed their support for the call of some countries in asia in creating non - nuclear weapon zones .
tang jiaxuan and ivanov signed the " agreement between the government of the people 's republic of china and the government of the russian federation on the exchange of visits by the two countries ' citizens . "
with pleasure , ivanov accepted the invitation for the visit , whose date will be decided by diplomatic channels .
dai xianglong said : in recent years , the banking sector has steadily increased its credit support to the western regions .
dai xianglong emphasized that since the strategy of developing the western regions is a long - term and complicated project of systems engineering , everything must be done in accordance with objective laws .
in keeping with the state 's policy of increasing financial investment to infrastructure construction in the western regions , commercial banks should be positively urged to subscribe treasury bonds and grant supporting loans in a timely manner .
positive steps should be taken to issue tuition loans and housing loans to students to promote personnel training .
fifth , supporting economic cooperation between the eastern and western regions and promoting the opening of the economy of the western regions to the outside world .
the gun fired , and the girl fell drenched in blood .
she was kayla rolland , a six - year old first - grader .
however , the one who killed her is not a vicious adult criminal , but a boy classmate of the same age .
the appalling news shocked the whole country .
in may of the same year , at a high school in georgia , a student opened fire and wounded six schoolmates .
" the gun - related disasters at schools are more dangerous than tigers . " this is the true portrayal of tragic cases at schools today and has become a serious issue of human rights in the united states now .
according to us mass media , at least one serious criminal case took place in 10 percent of schools in the united states each year and more and more cases involved gunshots .
from 1985 to 1995 , the number of juvenile criminal cases increased by 200 percent , of which gunshot cases increased by 300 percent .
in 1997 , 6,044 gun - killing cases involved youngsters from 15 to 24 years old .
the gun - shooting crimes committed by american youngsters , including those by children , are the direct evil consequence of an overflow of guns .
in recent years , the broad masses of american people strongly called for banning guns . nevertheless , their appeals were obstructed by the american rifle association , which has great economic power and political backing .
the violent culture and environment in the united states bring on the frequent gunshots on campus .
according to another study , a child in the united states will have seen 40,000 " performing " killers and 200,000 theatrical violent actions when reaching the age of 18 .
experts of the mental disease institute of yale university made a survey of 107 american youngsters and found that 51 percent of them admitted that they had encountered one or more instances of violence in their neighborhood and 12 percent of them said they had been attacked or threatened by guns and knives .
the frequent happenings of campus disasters have , in one aspect , deeply exposed the worrisome human rights situation in the united states .
an ironic thing was that , shortly before the disaster at buell elementary school , the us government released its annual " country reports on human rights practices . "
the report criticizes human rights situation in other countries and stops at nothing to attack other countries , while not uttering a single word about its own deteriorating human rights situation .
this has fully exposed the dual standards and hypocritical nature of the united states on the issue of human rights and can only be ridiculed by people in the world .
beijing , 1 march ( xinhua ) - - the chinese - language internet portal operator - - the sohu company - - and the mobile telephone supplier - - the nokia company - - signed an agreement in beijing today on a joint bid to provide upgraded mobile internet service to mobile telephone users in china .
this marks a great advance in the application of chinese - language mobile internet technology .
according to the agreement , both sides will actively establish a nokia wap ( wireless application protocol ) platform for mobile internet service and the sohu company will be responsible for providing the platform with network information content .
this cooperation will enable mobile telephone users in china to rapidly download the sohu website , acquire real - time information in fields , such as news , finance , and leisure , and complete mobile electronic commercial deals through handsets .
moreover , the upgraded mobile internet service will help further upgrade or improve traditional technologies so that the users also can get information and service when they are not on - line and thus greatly enhance the practical function of mobile internet service .
it has been reported that china has more than 400 million mobile telephone users at present and moreover , the number of the users is expanding continuously every year .
the ministry of education issued a notice today calling on the educational front to conscientiously study , deeply understand , and resolutely implement the spirit of the " remarks " and to strive to create a new situation in china 's educational reform and development .
it is necessary to conscientiously study the situation with young students ' thinking and moral characters in the new situation ; to conduct education on patriotism , collectivism , and socialism ; and to help students foster accurate world outlook and accurate outlook on life and value .
the ministry points out that with the focus on improving teachers ' moral characters and work styles , we should realistically strengthen the construction of the contingent of teachers and make ceaseless efforts to improve teachers ' ideological and political quality and professional ability .
it is imperative to further expand the dynamics of lightening the excessive heavy burdens of primary and middle school students and to comprehensively improve the educational and teaching quality .
the ministry notes that we should pay high attention to family education so as to acquire the support and cooperation of students ' parents .
the ministry stresses that education is a systems engineering .
the party and society as a whole should show concern over and support the work of strengthening and improving education .
extra - school educational institutions , such as children 's palaces , should conduct rich and useful extracurricular activities for young students .
it is now time for thoroughly resolving the issue of giving permanent normal trade relations to china .
he said : both the us government and enterprises have paid great attention to and supported the issue of giving permanent normal trade relations to china and have done much positive work . president clinton has also designated commerce secretary daley as the chief negotiator to take charge of this work .
sun zhenyu said that he believed that this issue would be rapidly resolved through the efforts of all sides .
in view of the fact that the us congressmen are more concerned about the issue of china carrying out bilateral trade and agricultural agreements , sun zhenyu said : china has already started carrying out the bilateral trade agreement and conducting special training for personnel and has checked and amended the existing regulations , systems and laws .
in the implementation of the agricultural agreement , china has done much work . after sending an orange delegation to california for observation , china also sent the wheat delegation to montana for observation and signed a contract on importing 5,000 tonnes of wheat from the united states .
this is the first time for the chinese government to import wheat from the western part of the united states , indicating the chinese government 's sincerity in carrying out the agreement .
sun zhenyu was invited by the us department of commerce to attend the three - day sino - us commercial discussions with an aim to preparing for the ministerial meeting of the joint committee of the sino - us business council to be held in beijing on 6 - 7 april .
shanghai , 2 mar ( xinhua ) - - two grand talent exchange fairs were held in shanghai a few days ago . for a while , many merchants and professionals gathered in shanghai , making the city bustling and thriving .
seeking the most excellent professionals is our urgent task to actively enter the chinese market , " said pu xiaojun , senior manager of the human resources department of the ( china ) lucent technologies , who specially came from beijing to personally advertise for talented persons .
instead of spreading advertisement data , many foreign - invested enterprises participating in these talent exchange fairs simply , clearly , and vividly displayed their images by showing pictures and eye - catching charts with videos .
" we do not set employment quotas . no matter how many they are , all the talents will be employed , as long as they are outstanding and are needed by our corporation , " said a pertinent responsible person of shenzhen huawei technology corporation .
the shanghai municipal overseas service corporation , a large state - owned corporation specialized in providing human resources and service for foreign - invested enterprises and agencies , sent last year some 23,000 employees to foreign enterprises and helped 300 - plus foreign agencies settle down in shanghai .
shen jianguo said : " foreign enterprises are entering shanghai at an obviously quickened pace .
the only way to satisfy their market demands is to build up an even bigger and brisker " reservoir " of talented people . " this reporter met zhang jie , a master degree candidate of tongji university in shanghai , at the crowded talent exchange fair .
this student majoring in information management , who is about to graduate this year , has finally signed , through repeated observations , a contract with datang telecommunications and technological corporation .
he said with feeling that the talent market was been increasingly open and job opportunities are increasing , but the requirements of employers are increasingly high .
wang shaochang , deputy head of the shanghai municipal personnel bureau , told this reporter that shanghai invited 7,000 professionals of various kinds from abroad last year , some 2,000 more than in the previous year .
and , the ranks of returned students initiating enterprises and consulting agencies in china have also expanded by 10 percent these years . he added that only by opening wide the door and setting up a vast stage for talent exchange and training can shanghai consistently enhance its international competitiveness .
this matter goes beyond a theoretical debate and becomes a major issue that directly puts the fate of the world 's six billion people at risk .
does the idea " human rights are above sovereignty " really stand to reason ? a brief analysis exposes that idea is not only specious but also absolutely untenable .
the state belongs to the people and the state sovereignty is the collective human rights of the people of a country .
losing sovereignty means loss of human rights .
patriotism has always been most revered by the people .
this is because the disaster of losing sovereignty far exceeds that of class oppression .
disaster does not hit a particular group only . when it strikes , no one can escape unscathed .
therefore to enjoy human rights , one must first of all have sovereignty .
the chinese people and people of other developing countries have known that without sovereignty there would be no human rights ; they have suffered from it and have taken the path of first striving for sovereignty before improving human rights .
deng xiaoping said : " honestly speaking , state rights are more important than human rights .
that is to say that the act of one country 's violation of another country 's sovereignty is no longer the main danger to the international security .
unjust and unreasonable international political order and international economic order are the most striking facts .
economic globalization has become a justifiable reason to violate another country 's sovereignty .
the new york times on 24 april 1999 noted that economic globalization has caused " the inevitable and voluntary weakening of the state sovereignty by the global economic juggernaut . "
economic globalization is often described as a double - edged sword with its accompanying pros and cons .
but now it does not equally treat all the countries ; it greatly favors some developed countries .
such unequal and unjust order seriously jeopardizes international peace and security and hurts the human rights of several billions of people in the world .
this is several times more serious than the acts of violation of human rights in some countries .
faced with such inequality and injustice , maintaining sovereignty becomes even more important to small and weak countries .
it is no wonder that the algerian president uttered at the united nations that " sovereignty is our last line of defense against an unequal world system . "
the state is a product of the development of human society .
it helps maintain certain " order " among people with different interests ; avoids the destruction of itself and society in clashes ; and externally it maintains sovereignty and guards against foreign aggression .
although individuals form a state , an individual cannot survive without the state .
marxists hold that a state may fall but that is the result of a future society .
at this stage , an individual cannot survive without the state .
if the state does not exist , what will people become ?
it will be in a state of anarchy . people will be led astray and become stateless . or people will become other country 's slaves .
in whichever condition , there will be no protection of people 's life , dignity , and freedom and people will lose the value as human beings .
that is why we chinese often say there will be no homes without a country .
some western countries describe the violation of another country 's sovereignty on the pretext of human rights as " not a dispute over interests but a fight over value . "
the value that is dear to the west can only be value in some western countries .
when talking about the war against the federal republic of yugoslavia , us president clinton said that the united states has " won a victory for our democratic value concepts and for an even stronger united states . "
those rich countries " think that they have done the right thing but other countries consider that a threat to their own security . "
what will the putting into practice of the " new interventionism " under the excuse of " human rights are above sovereignty " lead to ?
but as many acts involving human rights and as the line to decide on what is wrong and what is right remains blurred , the international community has yet to reach a consensus over that .
french daily " le figaro " wrote on 22 june 1999 : " as there has been so far not a single political organization that can determine the progress of the matter , a country 's sovereignty is thus trampled upon . "
as a matter of fact , western countries set the " standard . "
on 5 july 1999 , the us boston globe wrote , " countries are told that if they do not abide by the western standards , they incur the risk of interference . "
it is only the special privilege of a small number of western countries that interfere in other countries ' internal affairs under the pretext of " human rights are above sovereignty . " to be sure , small and weak countries do violate human rights .
some big and powerful western countries also violate human rights , some of them quite serious .
in fact , some already openly advocated practicing imperialism .
" the united states and nato have practically turned their backs on the stipulations of the un charter that strictly restrict international intervention in regional conflicts ( the may - june 1999 issue of the bimonthly foreign affairs ) .
to negate the un charter , some in the west even absurdly maintained that the un charter and the " world declaration on human rights " are contradictory .
britain 's new statesman on 9 april 1999 wrote that even if there is no basic contradiction between the stipulations of world order in the un charter and the rights expounded in the " world declaration of human rights " there also exists at least conflicts between the two .
whereas the charter forbids the use of force to violate a state 's sovereignty , the declaration guarantees the right of an individual to fight against a tyrannical state .
this is really incredible .
this shows that the united nations has the responsibility and right to stop any acts , including violation of human rights , which put international peace and security at risk . this also demonstrates that it is up to the united nations , not to any country , to decide on which acts endanger international peace and security .
therefore those who blame the un charter for giving protection to acts of human rights violation is nothing but an excuse .
the us chicago tribune stated that rather explicitly in an article published on 6 june 1999 : " a thorough change is taking place with regard to the concept of sovereignty over the past 10 years .
like it or not , the united states , the only superpower in the world , must assume leadership responsibility .
it follows that the united states must involve itself in every intervention act one way or another in the world . "
the paper continued : " if we want security at home , we must exercise leadership abroad . "
britain 's new statesman weekly on 9 april 1999 stated in an even explicit manner : " the united states has long waged an open campaign against international laws and the un charter . "
the articles cited above revealed the secrets of the call of " human rights are above sovereignty . "
first , the crux of the argument of " human rights are above sovereignty " is that sovereignty of a country can be violated .
second , countries that advocate and practice the argument " human rights are above sovereignty " are no other than " former colonial powers " ( to borrow the phrase of the french daily " le figaro " ) .
a country whose sovereignty is violated should be deeply grateful for the good deeds done by the violator country . if it does not understand that or even raises an objection , it is ungrateful and deserve death by thousand cuts !
the eighth workshop on regional cooperation for the promotion and protection of human rights in the asia - pacific region , which was jointly sponsored by the chinese government and the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights , was held in beijing from 1 - 3 march .
in a letter of congratulations to the workshop , chinese president jiang zemin said : it is an important task facing the international community to further strengthen international cooperation in the field of human rights and promote the development of the international cause of human rights in the new century .
we have both opportunities and challenges .
although we have differences on the issue of human rights due to different national conditions , we share common goals in promoting and protecting human rights . all countries should conduct dialogues and exchanges in the spirit of equality and respect to deepen mutual understanding , narrow differences , and expand common ground and seek common progress .
human rights , which is a historic product , represents a concept of development . it is a common aspiration of all mankind to promote the progress of the undertaking of human rights .
different countries have different focuses and methods to achieve their goals of human rights . in light of its own national situation , each country sets its own key goal of human rights to achieve . this action itself represents an item of basic human rights .
the chinese government has always attached great importance to human rights . in light of the universal principle of human rights and its concrete situation , it has made tremendous efforts to continuously promote the cause of human rights in china .
so long as china continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , china will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .
china has signed the international covenant on economic , social and cultural rights as well as the international covenant on civil rights and political rights . now relevant departments of the chinese government have made active preparations for the approval of these two covenants .
although countries in the asia - pacific region do not share a common position and viewpoint regarding human rights , it is obvious that they have more common points than differences .
china has been consistent in its position regarding the issue of human rights . china 's position has been to carry out dialogue and cooperation on the basis of equal consultation .
economic car competition has become more acute generally speaking , economic cars are referred to those cars whose prices are less than 10,000 yuan and the air displacement of engines is less than 1.3 liters .
because these cars are cheap , economical and practical , they have strong competitiveness in the rental car and household car markets .
in particular , if the fuel tax can be formally put into implementation this year , then , economic cars may probably get the greatest profits .
we cannot deny that at present china 's economic cars still have these characteristics , namely the structure of demand is fairly unitary , relying too much on the rental car and household cars markets .
last year , under the situation in which other types of cars showed no noticeable decline in their prices , there was an acute price war among china 's economic cars . this indirectly showed that the market demand for economic cars was not brisk .
experts said that viewed from a long - term basis , naturally , the prospects for china 's economic cars will be vast , but this does not imply that the economic cars market has completely started .
according to statistics , in five years , from 1988 to 1992 , the medium - and - high - class cars accounted for 12 percent of the number of cars used by civilians in china on average . however , by 1998 , the average number of these cars dropped to eight percent or so .
bieke and yage , the two brand - new car models introduced to the world market are more competitive in prices as compared with cars of the same category in foreign countries .
so , they have effectively stimulated the growth of china 's car market . meanwhile , the consumption structure of cars in china has gradually changed from mainly institutional purchase to mainly individual purchase to meet various demands . the increasing rise in the ratio of individual purchase of cars has determined the pattern of china 's car market .
that is , economic cars and medium - class cars should be the leading car models in the market . in spite of this , the technical level , manufacturing quality , the marketing idea , and the sales pattern of yage , bieke and audi a6 have brought fresh air to china 's car market .
most of these cars are produced by certain regions or enterprises , so the products can only be confined to economic cars or to sales only in a province .
should its subordinates get in touch with the ministry of state security , they will be considered as violating the law of heaven .
using other identities as disguise , personnel of the ministry of state security engage in intelligence gathering and infiltration activities . in hong kong , state security special agents have conducted their activities silently for many years .
on 1 february , in defiance of the chinese people 's strong objection and the overall situation of sino - us relations , the us house of representatives passed the so - called " taiwan security enhancement act " with 341 votes ( including 200 republicans , 141 democrats ) versus 70 votes .
this bill was initially proposed by jesse helms , chairman of the us senate foreign relations committee , and senator robert torricelli on 24 march 1999 .
faced with the tense cross - strait situation after the birth of the " two state theory " , the us executive branch , in order not to provoke already worsened sino - us relations , once explicitly expressed its objection to this bill , thus making it shelved for a while .
this time , the us congress , in defiance of the repeated warnings by the chinese government and the righteous strength at home , acted against the current of history and passed this notorious bill , the main driving force came from taiwan authorities ' bribes .
in the name list of senators and congressmen with whom the cassidy company is in frequent contact , half of them co - signed the " taiwan security enhancement act " in the senate and house of representatives .
it is understood that in order to expedite the introduction of the " taiwan security enhancement act " , the taiwan side last year paid the cassidy company 37 percent more public relations fees in six months , up from $ 400,000 in the second half of 1998 to $ 550,000 in the first half of 1999 .
us congress : why anti - china again and again ?
the development path of bilateral ties since the unfreezing of sino - us relations indicates that the nature of us taiwan policy has not been changed . the united states has always been the biggest obstacle to settling the taiwan issue and realizing the reunification of china .
the passage of the " taiwan relations act " not only brought sino - us relations , which had just been normalized , to the verge of retrogression , but also preset factors of instability in the development course of cross - strait relations , thus making the development of cross - strait relations something always ridden with crisis .
it is something left over in the history of sino - us relations that is contrary to the goodwill wishes of both the chinese and american peoples , so that sino - us relations entered the stage of developing amid struggle and progressing amid friction .
the us congress many times has played an ignominious role in sino - us relations and on the taiwan issue .
the adoption of the so - called [ " public law " ] [ guo nei fa 0948 0355 3127 ] towards the area of taiwan under china is obviously the united states ' wanton interference in china 's internal affairs .
but nevertheless , people have also noticed that the us government has time and again declared its objection to this bill , and president clinton has repeatedly said he " will veto this bill . "
hence , if this bill is finally passed , it will certainly aggravate the tense situation across the taiwan straits and undermine the asia - pacific region 's peace and stability .
as a spokesman of the white house said , the clinton administration would not accept this bill because it " will create instability for that region " .
the united states has also declared its stand of not supporting " taiwan independence , " not supporting " two chinas " or " one china , one taiwan " , not supporting taiwan 's accession to international organizations with country as the unit of membership .
they said : defending the people 's peace labor and safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity constitute the sacred mission entrusted by the constitution on the pla as well as the most collective manifestation of the army 's basic functions during the new historical period .
the pla should always , in the past , at present , or in the future , firmly and unswervingly consider the will of the state and the nation as the supreme will and consider the interest of the state and the nation as the supreme interest .
like revolutionaries of the older generation , we will certainly not hesitate to sacrifice our all for the reunification of the state and the happiness of the people and will never allow an inch of our territory to be separated from the motherland .
this unit 's party committee has guided officers and men to conduct an extensive discussion under the title " how to win the future regional war under high - tech conditions in the face of the complicated international situation . "
they said : no matter how science and technology develop , the decisive factor for the victory or defeat always lies in the people rather than materials . what we fight for is justice , and an army dedicated to a just cause will never be defeated .
